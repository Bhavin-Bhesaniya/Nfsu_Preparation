Introduction Web Technology :- 
 - Web Technology refers to various tools and techniques that are utilized in the process of communication
   between different types of devices over internet


 It can be classified into following sections :-
  World Wide Web (WWW) :- 
  - Web browsers
  - Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 
  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)


 Web Browser :- 
  - Application software to explore WWW to access web pages
  - Provides interface between server and client 
  - It Request to the server for web documents and services
  - It is program that display text, data, pictures, animation and video on Internet 

 Web Server :- 
  - Processes network requests of users and serves them with files that create web pages
  - This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

 Web Pages :- 
  - Digital document that is linked to the WWW and viewable by anyone connected to internet has web browser

 Web Development :- 
  - Process of building, creating and maintaining websites that works over the internet
  - It Includes web design, web publishing, web programming and database management 
  - Web Development can be classified into two ways :
 
  Frontend Development :- 
   - Part of website that user directly interacts 
   - Also known as 'client side' application

  Backend Development :- 
   - Part of website that users cannot see and interact
   - Server side website
   - Used to store and arrange data

Frontend Languages :-  
 HTML(Hypertext Markup Language):- 
  - Used to design front-end portion of web pages using markup language
  - Hypertext defines link between web pages 
  - Markup language define text documentation within tag which defines structure of web pages

 CSS(Cascading Style Sheets):-  
  - Simply designed language
  - Allows us to apply styles to web pages

 JavaScript :- Scripting language that used to make site interactive for the user

 AJAX(Asynchronous Javascript and XML):- 
  - Communicate with server without refreshing webpage and thus increasing user experience performance
 
 - There are many other languages through which do front-end development depending upon framework for 
   Ex :- Flutter(Dart), React(JavaScript), Django (Python)

 
 Front End Frameworks and Libraries : 
  CSS :-
    Library      :- Pure CSS
    Framework    :- Bootstrap, Bulma, Materialize, Semantic,Tailwind CSS
    Preprocesser :- SASS ,LESS
  
  JavaScript :-
    JavaScript Technology : ES6, TypeScript
    JavaScript Framework  : AngularJS, ReactJS, Vue.JS
    JavaScript Library    : jQuery, jQuery Mobile ,script.aculo.us ,P5.JS ,D3.JS ,Underscore.JS



Backend Language :- 
 PHP    :- Server-side scripting language because its code executed on server-side
 Python :- Python is programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently
 Java   :- Popular and widely used programming languages and platforms
 C#     :- C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C sharp”
 Golang :- Procedural and statically typed programming language having syntax similar to C programming language
 JavaScript :- Used as both (front end and back end) programming
 Node.js :- 
  - Open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside browser 
  - NodeJS is not framework and not programming language
  - Used for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App

 Ruby :-  
  - Dynamic, reflective, Pure object-oriented, general-purpose programming language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto
  - Everything in Ruby is an object except blocks but there are replacements too for it i.e procs and lambda
  - It act as sensible buffer between human programmers and underlying computing machinery
  
 DBMS (Database Management System):- Software which is used to manage database
 

 BackEnd Frameworks and Technology :-
  PHP    :- Laravel | CMS: WordPress
  NodeJS :- Express
  Python :- Django  | Package Manager: Python PIP
  Ruby   :- Ruby on Rails
  Java   :- Spring, Hibernate
  C#     :- .NET
  Database :-  
    Relation Database :- Postgre SQL, MariaDB, MySQL
    NoSql Database    :- MongoDB



Data Format :-  
 - Format of data is used by web applications to communicate with each other
 - It is light weight text based data interchange format which means, it is simpler to read and write

 XML(Extensible Markup Language) :-
  - Markup language that defines set of rules for encoding documents that is both human-readable and machine-readable
  
 JSON :- JavaScript Object Notation is format for structuring data

 API (Application Programming Interface):- 
  - Collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them



Web Protocols :- 
 - Set of rules followed by everyone for communicating over web
 
 HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):- 
  - Enable communications between clients and servers
  - It works as request-response protocol between client and server
  - Web browser may be client and application on computer that hosts web site may be server
  Other Protocols :- TCP/IP Model, UDP, FTP, SMTP, SOAP



Graphics :- 
 - Used to convey important points better than text does and beautify webpage

 Canvas :- HTML “canvas” element is used to draw graphics via JavaScript
 SVG    :- Scalable Vector Graphics defines vector-based graphics in XML format
