Von Neumann's Architecture(Stored Memory Program):- 
 Diagram :- 
          Main Memory
  Central Processing Unit (CPU)
    Register        ALU
    control unit
        Input/ Output System        
 - Store data and Program together in main memory
 - Through ALU we perform different operations such as addition
 - Register store temporary data and fastest Ex :- 8-bit, 1byte
 - Multiple Flip-Flop combine known as register
 - Control unit store timeing single and control signals
 - Timeing single specifiy instruction time and Perform operation in register used control signal
 


Register(Main Memory Unit):- 
 - Sequence of bit which size vary on 16 bit, 32 bit
 - Memory(4096 X 16)  4096 is no. of words and 16 bit word size (2^12)
 - Word is memory representation unit 


 Types of Register :-
  Address Register(AR)  :- Pickup data from specified memory location, Size depends on word representation power(0 to 11)
  Data Register(DR)     :- Store data, Size depend on words size(0 to 15)
  Accumulator           :- Store intermediate data, Size depend on words size(0 to 15)
  Program Counter(PC)   :- Store and Point address of next instruction, Size(0 to 11) 12 bit
  
  Instruction Register(IR) :- 
   - Instruction Format Diagram :-  I | Opcode | Operand 
   - Instruction length is 16 bit, operand size 12 bit, opcode 3 bit, 1 bit I 
   - Opcode specify operation while operand data is Available
   - In i we store 0 and 1 where 0 represent direct addressing and 1 represent indirect addressing

  Temporary Register(TR) :- Store temporary data, 16 bit 
  Input Register(INPR)   :- Get input from device
  Output Register(OUTR)  :- Represent output to device


Types of Bus(Address, Data, Control) :-

                    Memory Input Output

  Address Bus :- Carry address, 16 bit(2^16)                    
  Data Bus    :- Carry Data
  Control Bus :- Carry Control and timing signals
