Introduction to Internet :-
 - Internet is world-wide global system of interconnected computer network that use standard Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)
 - Every computer in internet is identified by unique IP address
 - IP Address is unique set of numbers(such as 110.22.33.114) which identifies computer location
 - DNS(Domain Name Server) is used to give name to the IP Address so that user can locate computer by name
 - Internet provided medium to publish and access information over web
 


Internet Evoloution :-
 - Concept of Internet was originated in 1969 from ARPANET
 - Advanced Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET) was developed by United States Department of Defense to provide
   communication 
 - Initially, there were only four nodes, formally called Hosts
 - 1972 ARPANET spread over global with 23 nodes located at different countries and thus became known as Internet
 - With invention of new technologies such as TCP/IP protocols, DNS, WWW, browsers, scripting languages etc.,
 
 Advantages    :- Social Networking, Online Services, Education and Technology,  Entertainment
 Disadvantages :- Privacy, Cyber Crime, Spamming
  


Extranet :-
 - Network within organization, using internet to connect to the outsiders in controlled manner
 Diagram :-  Individual User --> Internet --> Firewall --> Company(Extranet)

 Extranet Issues :-
  Hosting :
   - Where extranet pages will be held 
   - Host it on own server or with Internet Service Provider (ISP)in the same way as web pages
   - But hosting extranet pages on own server requires high bandwidth internet connection which is very costly

  Security :-
   - Additional firewall security is required which result in complex security mechanism and increase work load

  Accessing Issues :-
   - Information can not be accessed without internet connection.
   - However, information can be accessed in Intranet without internet connection

  Decreased Interaction :-
   - It decreases face to face interaction in business which results in lack of communication


 Extranet vs. Intranet :-
            Extranet	                               Intranet
  Accessed externally	                    Can not be accessed externally
  Extension of company's Intranet	        Only limited users of company access
  For limited external communication      Only for communication within company
  


Internet Reference Models :- 
 OSI(Open System Interface) Reference Model :-
  - Developed by International organization of Standardization(ISO) and therefore also referred ISO-OSI Model
  - OSI model consists of seven layers 
  - Each layer has specific function, however each layer provide services to layer above
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-osi_model.jpg

  Physical Layer :-
    - Activating, maintaining and deactivating physical connection
    - Defining voltages and data rates needed for transmission
    - Converting digital bits into electrical signal
    - Deciding whether connection is simplex, half duplex or full duplex

  DataLink Layer :-
    - Perform synchronization and error control for information which is to be transmitted over physical link
    - Enables error detection and adds error detection bits to the data which are to be transmitted
  
  Network Layer :-
    - To route signals through various channels to the other end 
    - Act as network controller by deciding which route data should take
    - Divide outgoing messages into packets and assemble incoming packets into messages for higher level

  Transport Layer :-    
    - Decide data transmission should take place on parallel paths or single path
    - Perform multiplexing, splitting on data
    - Break data groups into smaller units so that they are handled more efficiently by network layer
    - Guarantees transmission of data from one end to other end

  Session Layer :-
    - Manages messages and synchronizes conversations between two different applications
    - Controls logging on and off, user identification, billing and session management
  
  Presentation Layer :- 
    - Make sure that information is delivered in such form that receiving system will understand and use it

  Application Layer :-
    - Provide different services such as manipulation of information in several ways, retransferring files of
      information, distributing results etc..
    - Function such as LOGIN or password checking are also performed by application layer


 TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) Reference Model :-
  - Practical model that used in Internet
  - It combines two layers (Physical and Data link layer) into one layer (Host-to-Network layer)
  Diagram :- Application --> Transport --> Internet --> Host-to-Network
 
  Application Layer :-
    - Same Function as OSI Application layer
    Protocols used :- TELNET, FTP, SMTP, DN, HTTP, NNTP
  
  Transport Layer :-
    - It uses TCP and UDP protocol for end to end transmission
    - TCP is reliable and connection oriented protocol also handles flow control
    - UDP is not reliable and connection less protocol also does not perform flow control
    Protocols used : TCP/IP and UDP 
  
  Internet Layer :-
    - Allow host to insert packets into network and then make them travel independently to the destination
    - Order of receiving packet can be different from the sequence they were sent
    Protocols used : Internet Protocol (IP)
  
  Host-to-Network Layer :-
    - Lowest layer in TCP/IP model
    - Host has to connect network using some protocol, so that it can send IP packets over it
    - This protocol varies from host to host and network to network
    Protocols used: ARPANET, SATNET, LAN, packet radio



Domain Name System Architecture :-
 - Domain name system comprises Domain Names, Domain Name Space, Name Server

 Domain Names :-
  - Symbolic string associated with IP address
  - Several domain names available some of them are generic such as com, edu, gov, net etc, while 
    some country level domain names such as au, in, za, us etc.
  Example :-  
    Com - Commercial business       Edu	- Education Gov	           U.S. - government agency
    Int	- International entity      Mil	- U.S. military
    Net	- Networking organization   Org	- Non profit organization

 Domain Name Space :-
  - Refer hierarchy in internet naming structure
  - This hierarchy has multiple levels (from 0 to 127) with root at the top
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-domain_name_space.jpg
  - In above diagram each subtree represent domain
  - Each domain partitioned into sub-domain and these can be further partitioned and so on

 Name Server :-
  - Contain DNS database that comprises various names and their corresponding IP addresses
  - Since it not possible for single server to maintain entire DNS database 
  - Therefore information is distributed among many DNS servers
  - Hierarchy of server is same as hierarchy of names
  - Entire name space is divided into the zones

 Zones :-
  - Collection of nodes(sub domains) under main domain
  - Server maintains database called zone file for every zone
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-dns_zones.jpg
  - If domain is not further divided into sub domains then domain and zone refers to same thing
  - Information about nodes in sub domain is stored in servers at the lower levels 
  - However original server keeps reference to these lower levels of servers

 Types of Name Servers :-
  Root Server
   - Top level server which consists of entire DNS tree
   - It does not contain information about domains but delegates authority to the other server

  Primary Servers
   - Store file about its zone
   - It has authority to create, maintain and update zone file

  Secondary Server
   - Transfer complete information about zone from another server which may be primary or secondary server
   - Secondary server does not have authority to create or update zone file
 


 DNS Working :-
  - DNS translates the domain name into IP address automatically. 
  - Following steps will take you through the steps included in domain resolution process:
    - When we type www.tutorialspoint.com into the browser, it asks the local DNS Server for its IP address
    - Here the local DNS is at ISP end
    - When the local DNS does not find the IP address of requested domain name, it forwards the request to the 
      root DNS server and again enquires about IP address of it
    - The root DNS server replies with delegation that I do not know the IP address of www.tutorialspoint.com but know
      the IP address of DNS Server
    - The local DNS server then asks the com DNS Server the same question
    - The com DNS Server replies the same that it does not know the IP address of www.tutorialspont.com but knows the
      address of tutorialspoint.com
    - Then the local DNS asks the tutorialspoint.com DNS server the same question
    - Then tutorialspoint.com DNS server replies with IP address of www.tutorialspoint.com
    - Now, the local DNS sends the IP address of www.tutorialspoint.com to the computer that sends the request



Internet Services :- 
 Communication Services :- Offer exchange of information with individuals or groups
	Telnet            - Used to log onto remote computer that is attached to internet
	Electronic Mail   - Send electronic message over the internet

Internet Protocols
 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) :-
  - Reliable and connectionoriented protocol end-to-end packet delivery which correspond to Transport Layer of OSI Model
  - Provide Stream Data Transfer, Reliability, Efficient Flow Control, Full-duplex operation, Multiplexing
  - Ensures reliability by sequencing bytes with forwarding acknowledgement number that indicates to the 
    destination the next byte source expect to receive
  - It retransmits bytes not acknowledged with in specified time periodx


 IP(Internet Protocol) :-
  - Connectionless and unreliable protocol not Ensure guarantee of successfully transmission of data
  - To make it reliable it must be paired with reliable protocol such as TCP at transport layer
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-ip_datagram_structure.jpg


 User Datagram Protocol (UDP) :-
  - Connectionless and unreliable protocol and doesn’t require connection with host to exchange data
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-udp_datagram.jpg


 File Transfer Protocol (FTP) :-
  - Copy files from one host to another 
  - FTP creates two processes such as Control Process and Data Transfer Process at both ends 
  - Control connection is made between control processes while Data Connection is made between
  - FTP uses port 21 for control connection and Port 20 for data connection
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-ftp_model.jpg


 Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) :-
  - Transfer files without authentication
  - Unlike FTP, TFTP does not separate control and data information
  - No authentication exists, TFTP lacks in security features therefore it is not recommended to use TFTP
  Key points :-
   - Use UDP for data transport 
   - Each TFTP message is carried in separate UDP datagram
   - First two bytes of TFTP message specify type of message
   - TFTP session is initiated when TFTP client sends request to upload or download file
   - Request is sent from ephemeral UDP port to UDP port 69 of an TFTP server


 Telnet :-
  - Used to log in to remote computer on internet
  - The following diagram shows a person is logged in to computer A, and from there, he remote logged into computer B.
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-telnet.jpg


 Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) :-
  - Communication protocol defines mechanism for communication between browser and web server
  - Also called request and response protocol

  HTTP Request :-
   - Request line, Header Fields, Message body
   - Request line specifies request method i.e. Get or Post.
   - Second line specifies the header which indicates domain name of the server from where index.htm is retrieved
  
  HTTP Response :-
   - Status line, Headers, Message body 



Email :-
 - Service that Allow us to send message in electronic mode over internet
 - It offers an efficient, inexpensive and real-time mean of distributing information among people
 
 E-mail Protocols :-
  SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) :-
   - Proposed in 1982 used for sending e-mail efficiently and reliably over internet
   - SMTP is application level, connection oriented, text based protocol
   - It handles exchange of messages between e-mail servers over TCP/IP network
   - Apart from transferring e-mail also provides notification regarding incoming mail
   - When you send e-mail, your e-mail client sends it to your e-mail server which further contact recipient mail
     server using SMTP client
   - SMTP commands specify sender and receiver e-mail address, along with message to be send
   - Exchange of command between servers is carried out without intervention of any user
   - In case, message cannot be delivered error report is sent to the sender

  IMAP(Internet Message Access Protocol) :-
   - Proposed in 1986
   - Versions of IMAP :- Original IMAP, IMAP2, IMAP3, IMAP2bis, IMAP4
   - Allow client program to manipulate e-mail message on server without downloading them on local computer
   - E-mail is hold and maintained by remote server
   - Enables us to take any action such as downloading, delete mail without reading mail
   - Enables us to create, manipulate and delete remote message folders called mail boxes
   - Search e-mails and concurrent access to multiple mailboxes on multiple mail server

  POP(Post Office Protocol) :-
   - Support single client
   - There are several versions of POP but POP 3 is current standard
   - POP is application layer internet standard protocol
   - Support offline access to messages thus requires less internet usage time
   - Doesn't allow search facility 
   - To access message it is necessary to download them
   - Allow only one mailbox to be created on server
   - Not suitable for accessing non mail data
   - POP commands are generally abbreviated into codes of three or four letters Eg. STAT
 
 E-mail Working :-
  - Email working follow client server approach
  - Suppose person A wants to send an email message to person B
  - Person A composes messages using mailer program 
  - Message is routed to SMTP to person B’s mail server
  - Mail server stores email message on disk in an area designated for person B
  - Disk space area on mail server is called mail spool
  - Suppose person B is running POP client and knows how to communicate with B’s mail server
  - It will periodically poll POP server to check if any new email has arrived for B.As in this case, 
    person B has sent email for person B, so email is forwarded over network to B’s PC
  - This is message is now stored on person B’s PC
  Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/images/internet-email_working.jpg

 E-mail Security :-
  Spam :-

    - Floods e-mail account with unwanted e-mails, which may result in loss of important e-mails if inbox is full
    - Time and energy is wasted in reviewing and deleting junk emails or spams
    - Consume bandwidth that slows speed with which mails are delivered
    - Some unsolicited email may contain virus that can cause harm to computer
  
   Blocking Spams :-
    - While posting letters to newsgroups or mailing list, use separate e-mail address
    - Don’t give email address on websites as it can easily be spammed
    - Avoid replying to emails which you have received from unknown persons
    - Never buy anything in response to spam that advertises product

  Virus :-
   - Some emails may incorporate with files containing malicious script which when run on your computer may lead to
     destroy important data

  Phishing :-
   - Activity of sending emails to user claiming to be a legitimate enterprise
   - Main purpose is to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details
   - Such emails contains link to websites that are infected with malware and direct user to enter details at a
     fake website whose look and feels are same to legitimate one
