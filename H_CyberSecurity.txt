Introduction of CyberSecuirty :- 
 - Technique and practices that designed to protect digital data
 - Security related to protection of system security, network security, application and information security

 7 layer of cyber security :-
  1. Mission Critical Asset - Actual data need to protect 
  2. Data Security          - Control, Protect, storage and transfer of data
  3. Application Security   - Protect application access from unauthorized 
  4. Endpoint Security      - Protect connection between devices and network
  5. Network Security       - Protect organization’s network from prevent unauthorized access
  6. Perimeter Security     - Include physical and digital security methodologies that protect business overall
