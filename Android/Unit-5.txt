6 What is Control event - Represent various physical gestures that user can make on control such as dragging, click


===================================== Question - 2 3 Marks =====================================
1. Explain Button
 - Used to trigger event performed by user 
 - Buttons can be of two types :- System and Custom
 - We can define button type in storyboard file using init( type: ) method
 - Change button properties in xib in attributes inspector in utilities area 

 Syntax : class UIButton : UIControl

 Attribute :-
  Type  - Shape of button
  Title - Set text on button
  Font  - Set button font size, type
  Image - Set image on button
  State Config - Set button state by default is default     

 Example :-
  UIButton *roundRectButton = [UIButton buttonWithType: UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];
  [roundRectButton setFrame:CGRectMake(60, 50, 200, 40)];

  // sets title for the button
  [roundRectButton setTitle:@"Rounded Rect Button" forState: UIControlStateNormal];
  [self.view addSubview:roundRectButton];  

  ViewController.m :-
   (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
	  [self addDifferentTypesOfButton];
   }



2. Explain TextField
 - Defined as object which used to display editable text area in interface
 - Textfields are used to get text-based input from user

 Syntax : class UITextField : UIControl  

 Attributes :-
  text  - Represent current text which Accessed by text property of textfield at runtime
  color - Represent color of textfield text
  font	 - Represent font of text field's text, Accessed by font property of textfield object
  disabled     - Represent background image to display when textfield is disabled
  borderstyle - Represent visual style of textfield border

 Method :- func textFieldShouldBeginEditing(UITextField) -> Bool



3. Explain different types of Notification to User?
 - Notification provide short, timely information about events outside app such as in status bar
 - Apple provides Three types of notifications in iOS such as :
   NSNotificationCenter |  UILocalNotification | Remote Notifications 
 - Notification Center manage notifications since iOS 5

 Notification Center :-
  - Allow user to control and manage local and remote notification
  - Allow user to set type of alert displayed, change sound played or even disable notifications
  - To access Notification Center is window shade, pulled down from status bar 
  - Other part is accessed from Settings → Notification Center
  
 NSNotificationCenter :
  - Invisible to users but allow one part of app to let another part know something happened and action is required
  - Use to notify view like downloading data from remote server 
  - Used in similar way to delegates which notifying different part of app that required action  



4. Write program to vibrate Phone?  
 @IBAction func actionButtonOne(_ sender: Any) {
  AudioServicesPlayAlertSound(SystemSoundID(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate)) 
 } 
 // For Long Vibration
 @IBAction func actionButtonTwo(_ sender: Any) {
  let generator = UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .heavy) / light / medium 
  generator.impactOccurred() 
 } 
 - We using UIImpact Feedback generator to generate three different types of feedback
 



5. List out and explain TextView property 
 - UITextView is multiline text region which has built-in UIScrollView
 - It is not just text view but we can edit it, type in it and scroll it
 - Display text using custom style information and also text editing
 - Typically display multiple lines of text, when displaying large body of text document

 Syntax :- @MainActor class UITextView : UIScrollView

 Attribute :-
  font  - Set font properties
  textcolor - Set text color 
  textAlignment - Set text alignment for textview 
  attributeText - Supports multiple text styles
  isEditable    - Set UITextView is editable or disabled

 Example :-
  let uiTextView = UITextView()
  uiTextView.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 150)

 UITextView vs UITextField :-
  - UITextView is for multi-line input whereas UITextField by default is for single line only
  - UITextView does not provide placeholder/hint text by default



6. Explain Cocoa Touch?
 - Cocoa Touch is user interface framework provided by Apple for developing software for apple products
 - It primarily written in Objective-C language and based on Mac OS X
 - It was developed based on MVC architecture
 - Cocoa is commonly referred as combination AppKit frameworks
 - Cocoa Touch is combination of UIKit frameworks
 - Cocoa and Cocoa Touch sit on top of other collections of frameworks to create API stacks

 Features :-
 Core Animation: 
  - Helps to create rich user experiences by allowing for smooth movement of visual elements
  - Also fill in interim frames of animation with automatic timing and adjustment
  Provide :- OPENGL ES, Core Image, resoultion independence and Photo Library
        
 Core Data : 
  - Provides object-oriented data management solution and application's data model in logical and graphical way
  Provides :- SQLite, Share Data Among Applications, Access Contacts and Photo
  
 Core Audio : 
  - Profressional-grade technology for playing, processing and recording audio, makeing it easy
  Provides :- MediaPlayer, HTTP Live Streaming, AV Foundation

 User Applications       :-  Address Book, Core Location, Map Kit, Store Kit

7. Write Code to Display hello on Label using button click in Iphone? 
 import Cocoa
 class ViewController: NSViewController {
  @IBOutlet var strLabel: NSTextField!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad() 
    }
    override var representedObject: AnyObject? {
      didSet {   
    }
  }
  @IBAction func printHello(sender: AnyObject) {
    strLabel.stringValue = "Hello World !!!" }   
  }



8. Explain view controller?
 - ViewController manages hierarchy of views
 - It is foundation of Application's internal structure
 - It Responsible for displaying data of iOS application on screen
 - ViewController is parent for all views present on storyboard
 - Acts as interface between its Views (created by developer) and application data
 - Each application has at least one ViewController
 - It facilitates transition between various parts of user interface
 
 - Each ViewController in Storyboard assigned Class that inherits UIViewController class
 - UIViewController is parent class of all ViewControllers
 - It defines all methods and properties for managing our views
 
 Types of ViewControllers :-
  Content ViewController : 
   - Main type of View Controllers that we create
   - Hold content of Application screen
   - It manages discrete piece of application content
   - Also manages all Views itself
 
  Container ViewController :  
   - Acts as parent View Controller which collects information from child view controllers for navigation
   - Container ViewController only manages RootView which incorporates one or more Child ViewControllers
 


9. Write in detail : StoryBoard                              
 - Storyboard is visual representation of user interface of an iOS application
 - It introduced in iOS 5 which save time to building user interface
 - Allow us to create prototype and design for multiple view controller within one file
 - Also create transitions between view controllers
 - Before storyboard we only can use one XIB file per view
 - Storyboard is composed of sequence of scene, each of represent view controller and its views
 - Scenes are connected by segue objects which represent transition between two view controllers
 - Storyboard enables to connect view to its controller object and manage data transfer between view controllers
 - Storyboard is recommended way to design user interface of because they enable to visualize appearance and flow of 
   user interface on one canvas
 - When use storyboards deployment target should be 5.0 or higher
 - Storyboards all screens interconnect under one interface MainStoryboard.storyboard
 - Also helps in reducing coding of pushing/presenting view controllers
 
 - Xcode provides visual editor for storyboards
 - Here design user interface for application by adding view such as buttons, table views and text views 
 


10. Write program to show textField data inside label Using Iphone?
 import UIKit  
 class ViewController: UIViewController { 
  @IBOutlet weak var inputField: UITextField!
  @IBOutlet weak var echoLabel: UILabel!
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    echoLabel.text = inputField.text
  }
  @IBAction func refreshEcho(_ sender: UITextField) {
    echoLabel.text = sender.text
  }
 }



===================================== Question - 3 5 Marks =====================================
1. What is Xcode with features and application type?
 - Xcode is integrated development environment(IDE) developed by Apple for developing software for apple products
 - It is only officially-supported tool for creating and publishing apps to Apple’s app store
 - Xcode includes all tools needed to create app within one software package
 - With Xcode write, compile and debug app and when finished submit it to Apple app store
 - Xcode supports huge variety of programming languages such as Objective-C, Swift
 - It uses Cocoa, Carbon and Java programming models
 - Xcode give developer one single window in which to work

 Application Type :-
  Master Detail  - Template with pre-created Parent-child views with navigation controller for different orientation
  Page based     - Similar to iBooks app
  Single View    - Starter template with single view, able to Add multiple view whenever required
  Tabbed application - View controller with tab bar at bottom of the screen

 Features :-
  Source Editor    | Simulator    |  Compilers            | Asset Catalog          | XCTest Framework 
  Assistant Editor | Open Quickly |  OpenGL Frame Capture | Complete Documentation | Graphical Debugger
  Interface Builder Built-In      |   Integrated Build System 
  


2. Write Step to create iphone application?
 - Launch Xcode --> Create new project(File-> New -> Project)
 - Xcode open new window and display dialog in which you choose template
 - Select Single view application template
 - Provide product name and organization identifier because it used to create bundle identifier that identifies app
   throughout system
 - Enter Organizational name If you don’t belong to organization, enter your name
 - Click ok -> Main window appears, showing necessary files and resources for developing app



3. Explain MVC(Model-View-Controller) Framewrok in details        
 - MVC is Software architectural pattern
 - Separates application into three main logical components Model, View, Controller
 - It define way for objects to communicate with each other
 - Each of these three separated from each others by abstract boundaries
 - Application with MVC design are also more easily extensible than other applications
 - Many Cocoa technologies and architectures are based on MVC

 Diagram :- 
  View --->  Controller  ---> Model
      <---              <---

 Model :-
  - Lowest level of pattern that responsible for maintaining data and its related logic 
  - Represent data that transferred between controller components or other related business logic 
  - It Manipulates data and sends back to database or uses it to render same data
  - It Respond view request and also responds to instructions from controller to update itself

 View :-
  - Represents presentation of data
  - Views are created by collected data from model data
  - It request model to give information so that it presents output to user
  - Also represents data from charts, diagrams and tables
  
 Controller :-
  - Interface between Model and View components 
  - Controller handles user interaction
  - Take mouse and keyboard input from user, informing model and view to change as appropriate
  - Controller send's command to model to update its state
  - Also sends commands to its associated view to change view’s presentation 



4. List out and explain states of App Life Cycle?
 - IOS application run into several states which are called state of Application life cycle
 - UIApplicationDelegate contain app lifecycle method
 - Place lifecycle method in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions which run on app launch

 Life Cycle Method :-
  Not Running :- App is not yet launched or terminated by system or user
  Inactive    :- App in inactive or Foreground state but receiving events 
  Active      :- Normal mode for app when it is in foreground state and receiving all user events
  Background  :- App transitions into background state when user taps on home screen while using application
  Suspended   :- App remains in background and doesn't execute code
                 Foreground apps are always given priority over suspended apps and destroyed any time without notice

 Method :- Use all method with "application : "
  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions  : When application is launched initially 
  applicationWillEnterForeground : Called after didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
  applicationDidBecomeActive     : To perform any particular task when app comes into foreground
  applicationWillResignActive    : Notified when application become inactive
  applicationDidEnterBackground  : When app goes into background state after become inactive
  applicationWillTerminate       : Called when Application finally terminated from memory



5) Different Files available in IPHONE screen?
 AppDelegate.h :-
  - Inherited from UIResponder that handle ios event
  - UIViewController handle screen flow

 AppDelegate.m :-
  - UIApplication Delegate are defined here
  - All method defined above are UI Application delegates and contains no user defined method
  - To make window visible makeKeyAndVisible method is called

 ViewController.h :-
  - Inherit UIViewController that provides fundamental view management model for IOS Application

 ViewController.m :-
  - Implemented two methods that defined in base UIViewController class
  - Do initial setup in viewDidLoad which called after viewload

 Main.storyboard :-
  - Add, Edit and Delete Control
  - GUI Files that helps to draw graphics
  - Control placed in these files easily handle all environment
