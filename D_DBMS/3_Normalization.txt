Dependency :-

 Functional Dependency(FD) :- 
  - Relationship that exist between two attributes 
  - Typically exist between Primary key and non-key attribute within table
  Functional dependency written as :- Emp_Id â†’ Emp_Name | Emp_Name functionally dependent on Emp_Id

 Trivial functional dependency     :- B is subset of A
 Non-trivial functional dependency :- B is not subset of A
 Multivalued Dependency :- Consist two attribute that dependent on third attribute 
 Inclusion Dependency   :- Some column relation contained in other column | Ex :- Foreign key 

 

Inference Rule (IR):
 - Armstrong's axioms rule, conclude functional dependencies on relational database
 - Rules apply on set of FD(functional dependency) to derive other FD
 - Using IR derive additional functional dependency from initial set
 Reflexive Rule (IR1) | Augmentation Rule (IR2)(Partial dependency) | Transitive Rule (IR3) 
 Union Rule (IR4)     | Decomposition Rule (IR5)(Project rule)      | Pseudo transitive Rule (IR6) 



Normalization :-
 - Sset of rules that organizing data in database to minimize redundancy from relation
 - Normal form used to reduce redundancy from database table
 - Divide larger table into smaller and links them using relationship
 - Performance degrade in higher normal form | Time consuming

 1NF  :- Cannot hold multiple value hold only single-valued(Atomic value)
 2NF  :- Include 1NF and all non-key attribute fully functional dependent on primary key
 3NF  :- Include 2NF and No transition dependency  |  Reduce data duplication to achieve data integrity
 BCNF :- Boyce Codd's normal form Stronger definition of 3NF
 4NF	:- Include BCNF and No multi-valued dependency
 5NF	:- Include 4NF and Not contain join dependency and joining should be lossless
        All tables broken into as many as possible smaller table in order to avoid redundancy
        Project-join normal form (PJ/NF)



Relational Decomposition :- 
 - Eliminate problem of bad design like anomalies, inconsistencies and redundancy
 Lossless Decomposition :- If information not lost from relation that it will be lossless
 Dependency Preserving  :- Constraint of database where at least one decomposed table must satisfy every dependency
