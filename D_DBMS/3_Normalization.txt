Functional Dependency(FD) :-
 - Relationship that exist between two attributes 
 - Typically exist between Primary key and non-key attribute within table
 - X → Y  Left side of FD known as determinant right side of production known as dependent

 Functional dependency written as :- Emp_Id → Emp_Name   
  - Emp_Name is functionally dependent on Emp_Id

 Trivial functional dependency     :- B is a subset of A
 Non-trivial functional dependency :- B is not a subset of A



Inference Rule (IR):
 - Armstrong's axioms basic inference rule.
 - Used to conclude functional dependencies on a relational database.
 - Rule is type of assertion that apply to set of FD(functional dependency) to derive other FD
 - Using IR derive additional functional dependency from initial set
 Reflexive Rule (IR1) | Augmentation Rule (IR2)(Partial dependency) | Transitive Rule (IR3) 
 Union Rule (IR4)     | Decomposition Rule (IR5)(Project rule)      | Pseudo transitive Rule (IR6) 



Normalization :-
 - Process of organizing data in database to minimize redundancy from relation or set of relation 
 - Eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies
 - Divide larger table into smaller and links them using relationship
 - Normal form used to reduce redundancy from database table
 - Failure to eliminate anomalie leads to data redundancy cause data integrity and other problem as database grow 
 - Normalization is set of rules that helps to guide in creating good database structure

 Types of Normal Form :-
  1NF	Contain atomic value | Cannot hold multiple value hold only single-valued
  2NF	Include 1NF and all non-key attribute fully functional dependent on primary key
  3NF	Include 2NF and no transition dependency exist | Reduce data duplication to achieve data integrity
  BCNF	Stronger definition of 3NF is known as Boyce Codd's normal form
  4NF	Include BCNF and has no multi-valued dependency
  5NF	Include 4NF and not contain any join dependency, joining should be lossless
        5NF satisfied when all tables broken into as many tables as possible in order to avoid redundancy
        Also known as Project-join normal form (PJ/NF)

 Advantages    :- Minimize data redundancy | Data consistency |
 Disadvantages :- performance degrades when higher normal forms | Time consuming



Relational Decomposition :- 
 - Decomposition used to eliminate problems of bad design like anomalies, inconsistencies, and redundancy
  
 Lossless Decomposition :-
  - If information not lost from relation that decomposed then decomposition will be lossless
  - Guarantees that join of relation result in same relation as it was decomposed
  
 Dependency Preserving :- 
  - Important constraint of the database where at least one decomposed table must satisfy every dependency



Multivalued Dependency :- 
 - When two attributes in table independent of each other but both depend on third attribute
 - Consist two attribute that dependent on third attribute that's why it always require at least attribute



Inclusion Dependency :-
 - Statement in which some column of relation are contained in other column
 - Ex :- Foreign key 



Canonical Cover(Irreducible):- 
 - Set of functional dependencies FD simplified set of FD that has similar closure as original set FD
