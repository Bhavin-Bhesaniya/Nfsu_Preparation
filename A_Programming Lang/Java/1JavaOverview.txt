Introduction :-
 Basic :-
  - Developed by James Goshling at Sunmicrosystem and released in 1995 
  - Why JAVA not fully oop ? -> Support primitive datatype
  - Java Has no pointers and all code written in class and object
  - Pass non-primitve data-type always reference in function so that no bad memory allocation
  - James initialized java project in june 1991 for setTop box
  - Initially language called 'oak'(Tree outside) than 'Green' than 'Java' choose from random word
  - 13 November,2006 sun released much as free and open source software under GPL license



 Feature :-
  Object Oriented :- 
  Platform independent :- Java byte code interpreted by any machine which has jvm 
  Simple               :- Syntax is easy to learn and you master in oop it would be more easy language
  Secure               :- Built-in Feature that enables us to develop virus-free systems
  Architecture-Neural  :- Compiled code executable on many processor with java run time 
  Portable             :- Architecture-Neural and no implementation dependent makes java portable 
  Robust               :- Java eliminated error during compile time or runtime which maintains workflows 
  Multi-thread         :- Perform many task simultaneously , lightweight Process
  High-performance     :- Using Just-In-Time Compiler enables performance
  Dynamic              :- Carry runtime information that used to verify and resolve access to objects on runtime
  WORA(Write once run anywhere) 



 Naming Convention Rules :-
  class/interface :-Topcapital //First character is capital
  method 		 :- getRequest    //First character is small each internal word is capitalized
  constant	 :- MAX_VALUE     //All letters are uppercase 
  Variable   :- int a = 10;		//No whitespace,symbols and start with digit //Allow underscore and $ at start of variable 
  package    :- java.io.*;		//all package names in lowercase	



 Intro JDK, JRE, JVM :-
  What is JDK(Java Development Kit)?
   - JDK is software development kit required to develop applications in Java
 
  What is JVM(Java Virtual Machine)?
   - Acts as a runtime engine to run java application and call main method
   - When run Java program, Java compiler compile Java code to bytecode
   - Then JVM translates bytecode into native machine code(Set of instructions that computer's CPU executes directly)
   - Since JVM ​executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent
   - Part of JRE(Java Runtime Enviroment)

  What is JRE(Java Runtime Environment)?
   - JRE is software package that provide Java class libraries, JVM and other components that required to run Java code 
   - JRE is superset of JVM

  JDK = JRE + DEVELOPMENT TOOLS  (PLATFORM INDEPENDENT)
  JRE = JVM + LIBRARY CLASS 	(JVM PLATFORM DEPENDENT)
 
  Basic Jvm Working Cycle :-
    .java -> javac ->.class(same class name) with bytecode(run any machine) -> jvm -> machine code 
 
  
  Jvm Components Helps to Run Java :-
   JVM ClassLoader:- Responsible for Loading, Linking, Initalization

	  Loading :- Read .class file, generate corresponding binary data and save it in method area
    Linking :- Perform verification,preparation,and resolution(optionally)
	  Initalization :- Execute from top to bottom and all static variable are assigned with their values defined into code
    
			       			 req							req
	 System class loader ---> extension class loader --->bootstrap class loader --> If class found bootstrap path class loaded otherwise  
        |         														|
       	|	 extension move to system class loader ---<- <- Move Back to the extension class loader 
		(if system class loader fail load at starting)		path not found move to extension class
			|
		error : java.lang.ClassNotFoundException


   JVM MEMORY :-
    Methodarea  :- All class level information are stored like classname,variable,method etc 
    HeapArea    :- Information of all object is stored per jvm has one Heap area and it is a shared resource
    Stackarea   :- For every thread jvm create run-time stack which is stored hear
    PcRegister  :- Store current execution instruction of thread and each thrad have separate registers
    NativeMethodStack :- For every thread it's created that store thread native information
 

   EXECUTE ENGINE :-
    - Execute ".class"(bytecode) 
    - Read bytecode linebyline and use data and information present in various memory area and execute instrution
    Interpreter:- Interpretes bytecode line by line and executes 
    JIT(JUSTINTIME)  :- Compiles entire bytecode and convert into native code so whenever interpreter call method 
                        repeated jit provide direct native code for that part
    GarbageCollector :- It destroys un-referenced objects / free heap memory by destroying unreachable object 


   JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE (JNI):-
    - Interacts with native method libraries and provide native libraries(c/c++)required for execution 
    - Enable jvm to calls native libraries (c/c++)
 
   JVM STACK AREA :-
    - Every thread jvm create separate stack at the time of creation thread creation 
    - Perform 2 Operations :- pushes and pops the stack
    - Stack for particular thread may be termed as run-time stack
    - After all methods call stack empty and it becomes destroyed just before thread terminate
    - Each entry in the stack is called StackFrame or ActivationRecord

   JVM SHUTDOWNHOOK :-	
    - Special construct that allows developers to plug in piece of code to be executed when JVM is shutting down
    - Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(Thread) method

   JAVACLASS FILE :- Containing javabytecode and .classs extension that enable to run in jvm
    


 DIFFERNCE BETWEEN JDK,JRE,JVM :-
  JDK :- Used to create java application conatin jre, interpreter/loader, javac, archiver(jar), javadoc and other tool
  JRE :- JAVA RTE(RUNTIME ENVIROMENT) Provide minimum requirement for executing java application
  JVM :- Runtime instance when write java command on command prompt to run java class, an instance jvm is created

  DIFFERNCE :- 
  - Jdk provide develop and execute java program/ include development tool , jre 
  - JRE provide package to run program not develop 
  - JVM is inbuilt in both/when run program from jdk or jre jvm exectue line by line program known as interpreter

  HOW JRE WORKS :-
   .java -> .class    -> classloader/bytecode verifier -> interpreter -> runtime -> hardware	
	          \-/
		LOAD FROM HARDDISK,NETWORK OR OTHER RESOURCES
    compile       -> RUNTIME

  Interaction between jdk and jre :-
								/ JRE 
  javasourcecode -> jdk(java compiler) ->java bytecode -> ( jvm (jit) ) 
							(Hardware platform)



Variable :-
 - Variable is location in memory (storage area) to hold data
 - To indicate storage area, each variable should be given unique name (identifier)

 Declaration Rules :-
  - Start with letters, _ , $
  - Not start with number
  - Not allows whitespace and special Symbols

 Types :-
  Local Variables   - Declared inside method                     
  Parameters        - Declared in method parameter 
  Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields) - Declared inside class but outside method
  Class Variables (Static Fields)        - Declared inside class but outside method with static keyword

 Note :- 
  - Java is statically-typed language so all variables must be declared before they used
  - We cannot change data type of variable in Java within same scope

 Null :-
  - Null is not object or neither a type it is special value
  - Every reference variable in java has by default value is null / case-sensitive



Literal :-
 - Represents Fixed Value(Declare variables with values)

 Types :-
  Boolean - True or False
  Integer - Without any fractional part or exponation part(binary(0b),decimal(27),octal(027),Hexadecimal(0x27)) 
  Float   - float(3.4f) , double(3.3445e2)
  String  - Sequence of characters enclosed inside double-quotes("Java")
  Character - unicode character enclosed inside single quotes('a')Use :- escape sequences(\n,\b,\r,\t,\\,\',\'")
    


Identifier And Keyword :-
 - Identifiers are the name given to variables, classes, methods, etc..

 Rules :-
  - Case-sensitive and not be keyword
  - Start with letters, _ , $
  - Not start with number
  - Not allows whitespace and special Symbols

 Keyword :-
  - Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Java programming that have special meanings for compiler

  Keywords List :-
  int   void    byte    char   boolean double  short  long   final     const    enum
  if    else    for     while   do      goto   return  break  continue  default
  try   catch	  assert  throw	 throws
  case  switch  this	
  class    new      static      private	  protected	  public
  import   package  implements  interface extends
  abstract finally	instanceof  strictfp	super       
  transient	synchronized  volatile  native



DataType :-
 - Specify type of data that can be stored inside variables in Java

 Primitive datatype :- 
  - Predefined by language and named by keyword 
  - Default value is 0

 DataType   Range of bytes         Sizebyte    Ex
  byte       -128 to 127                1     B1 = 100;   
  short      -32768 to 327676           2     B2 = 20; 
  int        -2,147,483,648 to 7        4     B3 = 20;
  float      6 to 7 decimal             4     B5 = 3.3f;
  double     15 decimal                 8     B6 = 7.44d;
  long       -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 7  B4 = 45;
  boolean    true or false              1bit  B7 = false;
  char                                  2     B8 = 'F';

 Non-Primitive type :- 
  - Reference variable that are created using constructors of the classes that Used to access object
  - Declared for specific type so value can't Change
  - Default value is null
  Ex :- String, Array, Class, Object

 Type Casting :-
  - Method or process that converts datatype into another datatype in both ways manually and automatically
  - Automatic conversion is done by the compiler and manual conversion performed by programmer

  Widening casting(automatically) :- Convert smaller type to larger type
   Ex :- byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double 

  Narrowing casting(Manually) :- Convert larger type to smaller type
   Ex :- double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte



Operator :-
 - Symbol that perform operations on variables and values
 Arithmatic :- + , - , * , / , %   
 Assignment :- = , += , -= , *= , /= , %= , &= , |= , ^= , >>= , <<=
 Realtional :- == , != , > , <  , >= , <=
 Logical    :- && , || , !
 Unary      :- -, +, ++ , -- , !(Logical Complement Operator):inverts the value of a boolean
 Ternary    :- Condition ? If(true) : If(false) 
 Bitwise    :- &, |, ^(XOR), ~(Complement Operator), << , >> , >>>(unsigned)
 New        :- New operator instantiates class dynamically by allocating at run time
 instanceOf :- Check type if object is instance of class, subclass or interface(result =str instanceof String)

 Operators Precedence :-

    Assignment	    = += -= *= /= %= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=	                      Right to left



Input/Output :-
 Output :-
  - method to print data in java
  - System is a class 
  - out is public static field: accept user data 
  1)System.out.print()  - Print string inside quotes 
  2)System.out.println()- Same work like print but add new line in the end 
  3)System.out.printf() - Provides formatting same as c/c++ 

 Input :-
  - Get Input from user
  - Use Scanner class which we import from java.util.Scanner 
  Syntax :- Scanner usrInput = new Scanner(System.in);
  usrInput.nextInt(); - Take integer value from user 

 More Method :- 
  - nextFloat(), nextDouble(), nextLong, nextByte(), nextFloat()
  - next()Read input upto whitespace, does not read newline character in your input created by hitting "Enter"
  - nextLine()read line of text , returns after reading that newline
  - nextBigInteger, nextBigDecimal() requires import from java.math. package
  - System.in take standard input from user
  - Close() method to close object
  - Scanner class reads entire line and divides line into tokens which use for compiler to process input



Expressions, Statements, Blocks and comment :-

 Expressions :- Consist of variables, operators, literals and method calls
 Statements  :- Each statement is complete unit of execution
              - Convert expression into statement by terminating expression with a " ; "  Known as expression statement
              Ex :- int score = 9*5;
 Blocks  :- Block is group of statements (zero or more) that is enclosed in curly braces { }
 Comment :- Portion of program that are completely ignored by Java compilers 
          - Helps progrmmers to understand code
          Type :- Single line :- //     |   Multi-Line  :- /* */



Control Flow :- 
 Condition :-
  If         :- if(condtion){}
  If..Else.. :- if(condtion){}else{}
  Else-if    :- if(condtion1){}else if(condtion2){}else{}
  Ternary    :- var = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
 
 Switch :-
  - Expression evaluated once then compared with values of each case statement
  - If match, associated block of code is executed otherwise default block executed
  - No duplicate case statement allowed
  Syntax :- 
    switch(expression)  
    {
      case n:
      //code block
      break;
    
      default:
      //code block
    }

 Loops :- Execute block of code as long as condition is true, to save time, reduce errors, make code readable   
  for       :- for (initialization ; condition ; increment/decrement){ //code } 
  while     :- while(condition){ //code }
  do..while :- do{ //code }while(condition)
  foreach   :- for(type variableName : arrayName){ //code }

 Control Statement :- 
  break  :- Terminates loop immediately and control of program moves to next statement 
          - Use label break statement to terminate outermost loop as well Ex :- break second: (This is label use)
  continue :- Skip current iteration of loop and go next iteration
  Note :- Java not support goto but use  " label: " instead of goto
        - Label declare starting point of the loop 



Array :- 
 - Array is collection of similar types of data

 Declare Array :- 
  1)dataType[] arrayName;                                      //Single-Dimensional Array
    arrayName = new dataType[ArraySize];
  2)dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[ArraySize];
  dataType[][] arrayName = new dataType[ArraySize][ArraySize]; //Multi-Dimensional Array


 Initialize Array :- 
  - Value type same as dataType and compiler automatically specifies size of array
  EX :- 
   dataType[] arrayName = {1,2,3}; 
   arrayName[0] = 12; //Initialize array with indexno start from 0 end with n-1
   
 Access Array :- 
  System.out.println(arrayName[0]);                           //Access array with it index No
  for (int i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++){ arrayName[i];}  //Through Loops where length property get size of array
  for ( i : arrayName ){a;}
