Introduction :-
 Basic :-
  - Developed by James Goshling at Sunmicrosystem and released in 1995 
  - Why JAVA not fully oop ? -> Support primitive datatype
  - Java has no pointers and all code written in class and object
  - James initialized java project in june 1991 for setTop box
  - Initially language called 'oak'(Tree outside) than 'Green' than 'Java' choose from random word
  - 13 November,2006 sun released much as free and open source software under GPL license
  
  Comment    :- Helps progrmmers to understand code            |  Single line :- //  |  Multi-Line  :- /* */
  Expression :- Consist of variables, operators, literals and method calls
  Statement  :- Each statement is complete unit of execution                 | Ex :- int score = 9*5;
  Blocks     :- Group of statement that enclosed in curly braces { }



 Feature :-
  Object Oriented      :- Everything is object
  Platform independent :- Java byte code interpreted by any machine which has jvm 
  Simple               :- Syntax is easy to learn and master in oop would be more easy language
  Secure               :- Built-in Feature that enables us to develop virus-free systems
  Architecture-Neural  :- Compiled code executable on many processor with java run time 
  Portable             :- Architecture-Neural and no implementation dependent makes java portable 
  Robust               :- Java eliminated error during compile time or runtime which maintains workflows 
  Multi-thread         :- Perform many task simultaneously , lightweight Process
  High-performance     :- Using Just-In-Time Compiler enables performance
  Dynamic              :- Carry runtime information that used to verify and resolve access to objects on runtime
  WORA(Write once run anywhere) 



 Naming Convention Rules :-
  method 		 :- getRequest  // First character is small each internal word is capitalized
  constant	 :- MAX_VALUE   // All letters are uppercase 
  Variable   :- int a = 10;	// No whitespace, symbols and start with digit //Allow underscore and $ at start of variable 
  package    :- java.io.*;	// all package names in lowercase	
  class/interface :-Topcapital //First character is capital



 Intro JDK, JRE, JVM :-
  What is JDK(Java Development Kit)?
   - JDK is software development kit required to develop applications in Java
 
  What is JVM(Java Virtual Machine)?
   - Acts as a runtime engine to run java application and call main method
   - Since JVM ​executes Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent

  What is JRE(Java Runtime Environment)?
   - JRE is software package that provide Java class libraries, JVM and other components that required to run Java code 

  JDK = JRE + DEVELOPMENT TOOLS  (PLATFORM INDEPENDENT)
  JRE = JVM + LIBRARY CLASS 	(JVM PLATFORM DEPENDENT)
 
  Basic Jvm Working Cycle :-
    .java -> javac ->.class(same class name) with bytecode(run any machine) -> jvm -> machine code 
 
  
  Jvm Components Helps to Run Java :-
   JVM ClassLoader:- Responsible for Loading, Linking, Initalization

			       			 req							req
	 System class loader ---> extension class loader --->bootstrap class loader --> If class found bootstrap path class loaded otherwise  
        |         														|
       	|	 extension move to system class loader ---<- <- Move Back to the extension class loader 
		(if system class loader fail load at starting)		path not found move to extension class
			|
		error : java.lang.ClassNotFoundException


   JVM MEMORY :-
    Methodarea  :- All class level information are stored like classname,variable,method etc 
    HeapArea    :- Information of all object is stored per jvm has one Heap area and it is a shared resource
    Stackarea   :- For every thread jvm create run-time stack which is stored hear
    PcRegister  :- Store current execution instruction of thread and each thrad have separate registers
    NativeMethodStack :- For every thread it's created that store thread native information
 

   EXECUTE ENGINE :-
    - Execute ".class"(bytecode) 
    - Read bytecode linebyline and use data and information present in various memory area and execute instrution
    Interpreter:- Interpretes bytecode line by line and executes 
    JIT(JUSTINTIME)  :- Compiles entire bytecode and convert into native code so whenever interpreter call method 
                        repeated jit provide direct native code for that part
    GarbageCollector :- It destroys un-referenced objects / free heap memory by destroying unreachable object 


   JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE (JNI):-
    - Interacts with native method libraries and provide native libraries(c/c++)required for execution 
    - Enable jvm to calls native libraries (c/c++)
 
   JVM STACK AREA :-
    - Every thread jvm create separate stack at the time of creation thread creation 
    - Perform 2 Operations :- pushes and pops the stack
    - Stack for particular thread may be termed as run-time stack
    - After all methods call stack empty and it becomes destroyed just before thread terminate
    - Each entry in the stack is called StackFrame or ActivationRecord

   JVM SHUTDOWNHOOK :-	
    - Special construct that allows developers to plug in piece of code to be executed when JVM is shutting down
    - Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(Thread) method

   JAVACLASS FILE :- Containing javabytecode and .classs extension that enable to run in jvm
    


 DIFFERNCE BETWEEN JDK,JRE,JVM :-
  JDK :- Used to create java application conatin jre, interpreter/loader, javac, archiver(jar), javadoc and other tool
  JRE :- JAVA RTE(RUNTIME ENVIROMENT) Provide minimum requirement for executing java application
  JVM :- Runtime instance when write java command on command prompt to run java class, an instance jvm is created

  DIFFERNCE :- 
  - Jdk provide develop and execute java program/ include development tool , jre 
  - JRE provide package to run program not develop 
  - JVM is inbuilt in both/when run program from jdk or jre jvm exectue line by line program known as interpreter

  HOW JRE WORKS :-
   .java -> .class    -> classloader/bytecode verifier -> interpreter -> runtime -> hardware	
	          \-/
		LOAD FROM HARDDISK,NETWORK OR OTHER RESOURCES
    compile       -> RUNTIME

  Interaction between jdk and jre :-
								/ JRE 
  javasourcecode -> jdk(java compiler) ->java bytecode -> ( jvm (jit) ) 
							(Hardware platform)



Variable :-
 - Variable is location in memory (storage area) to hold data
 - To indicate storage area, each variable should be given unique name (identifier)

 Declaration Rules :-
  - Start with letters, _ , $
  - Not start with number
  - Not allows whitespace and special Symbols

 Types :-
  Local Variables   - Declared inside method                     
  Class Variables    (Static Fields)     - Declared inside class but outside method with static keyword
  Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields) - Declared inside class but outside method

 Note :- 
  - Java is statically-typed language so all variables must be declared before they used
  - We cannot change data type of variable in Java within same scope

 Null :-
  - Null is not object or neither a type it is special value
  - Every reference variable in java has by default value is null / case-sensitive

 Note :- Example in A1VariableDataType.java file



Literal :-
 - Represent Fixed Value(Declare variables with values)

 Types :-
  Boolean - True or False
  Integer - Without any fractional part or exponation part(binary(0b),decimal(27),octal(027),Hexadecimal(0x27)) 
  Float   - float(3.4f) , double(3.3445e2)
  String  - Sequence of character enclosed inside double-quotes("Java")
  Character - unicode character enclosed inside single quotes('a') 
  Escape sequences :- (\n,\b,\r,\t,\\,\',\'")
    


Identifier And Keyword :-
 - Identifiers are the name given to variables, classes, methods, etc..

 Rules :-
  - Case-sensitive and not used keyword
  - Start with letters, _ , $
  - Not start with number
  - Not allows whitespace and special Symbols

 Keyword :-
  - Predefined, reserved words that cannot used as identifier that have special meanings for compiler

  Keywords List :-
  int   void    byte    char   boolean double  short  long   final     const    enum
  if    else    for     while   do      goto   return  break  continue  default
  try   catch	  assert  throw	 throws
  case  switch  this	
  class    new      static      private	  protected	  public
  import   package  implements  interface extends
  abstract finally	instanceof  strictfp	super       
  transient	synchronized  volatile  native



DataType :-
 - Specify type of data that stored inside variables in Java
 - Default value of primitive datatype is 0 and user-defined type is null
 
 Primitive datatype :- Predefined by language and named by keyword 
  DataType   Range of bytes            Sizebyte      Ex
  byte       -128 to 127                1      B1 = 100;   
  short      -32768 to 32767            2      B2 = 20; 
  int        -2,147,483,648 to 7        4      B3 = 20;
  float      6 to 7 decimal             4      B5 = 3.3f;
  double     15 decimal                 8      B6 = 7.44d;
  long       -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 7 8 B4 = 45L;
  boolean    true or false              1bit   B7 = false;
  char                                  2      B8 = 'F';


 Non-Primitive type :- 
  - Reference variable that created using constructor of classes to access object
  - Declared for specific type so value can't Change
  - Default value is null
  - No fixed size
  Ex :- String, Array, Class, Object


 Type Casting :-
  - Method or process that converts datatype into another datatype in both ways manually and automatically
  - Automatic conversion done by compiler and manual conversion performed by programmer

  Widening casting(automatically) :- Convert smaller type to larger type
   Ex :- byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double 

  Narrowing casting(Manually) :- Convert larger type to smaller type
   Ex :- double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

  while     :- while(condition){ //code }
  do..while :- do{ //code }while(condition)
  foreach   :- for(type variableName : arrayName){ //code }


 Control Statement :- 
  break    :- Terminates loop immediately and control of program moves to next statement 
  continue :- Skip current iteration of loop and go next iteration
  Note :- 
   - Java not support goto but use  "label:" instead of goto
   - Use label break statement to terminate outermost loop as well Ex :- break second: (This is label use)
   - Label declare starting point of loop 



Array :-
