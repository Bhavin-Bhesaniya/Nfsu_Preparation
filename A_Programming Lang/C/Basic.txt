 Intro :-
  - Developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at bell labs
  - First implmented in DEC PDP-11 Computer in 1972 and in 1978 Brain Kernigham and Dennis release Publicly(K&R)
  - Language Fromalized in 1988 ANSI(American National Standard Institute)
  - Unix totally written in C
  - Extension is .c
  - Case sensitive
  - C is compiler based language
  - Must contain main() function from when code start execution
  - 0 or getch() statement inside main() function is "Exit Status" of program
  - In C ;(SemiColon) is statement terminator for each individual statement
  

 Installation :-
  gcc -v on linux to check
  MinGW  on windows

 
 C Program Structure :- .c --> .out(Executable Code) --> Output
  Preprocessor Commands    - Tells compiler Include library(stdio.h) file before going to actual compilation
  Functions                - main() function from where program execution begin  
  Variables                  
  Statements & Expression
  Comments
 
 
 Token :- Token is either keyword, identifier, constant, string literal or symbol
 WhiteSpace :- Used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments which ignore by compiler


 Comments :- 
   - Comment are ignored by compiler that programmer add to make code easier to read and understand
  Type :- //       - Single-line comment  
          /*...*/  - Multi-line comment 



 Keyword :-
  - Special meaning for compiler that we can not used as identifier 
  - All keyword must written in lower case
  
  All keywords in ANSI C :-
    void     int        char    double  float  short	signed  unsigned  long	
    if       else       switch  case    break  continue goto
    for      while      do      return
    const    enum       extern  default
    auto	   register	  struct
    volatile static	    sizeof	typedef union
   


 Identifier :-
  - Identifier is name used to identify variable, function or any other user-defined item
  - Set of Alphabets, letters and special character
  
  All Identifier List :-   
    CharacterSet       - A-Z,a-z 
    Digit              - 0 to 9     
    Special Character  - 31
    WhiteSpace Character - Blank Space, Horizontal Tab, Carriage Return and Form Feed   

   Rules :-
    - First letter either letter or underscore cannot use digit or any special character
    - You cannot use keyword name as identifier
    - Name Must be unique 



 Variable :-
  - Container (storage area) to hold data which identify by its name
  - C is strongly typed language means that variable type cannot be changed once it is declared 
  - extern used to declare variable in any place
  - You can declare variable multiple times but defined only once

  Ex :- 
    int intValue = 10; // declare variable with int type
    intValue = 10.10;  // Wrong cannot change int to float
    float a,v,c;       // Variablelist with no value
    int g = 10, n = 20;
  
  - Expression that refer to memory location are called "lvalue" expression
  - rvalue refers to data value that is stored at some address in memory
  
  Scope :-
   - Defined scope for variable or function can be accessed or not
   - Inside function or block called local variable and outside called global variable
   - Local variable can be accessed inside function or block only not accessible outside
   - Global variable can be accessed anywhere in program throughout program 
   - Local variable not initialized by system you must initialize it while global variable initialized automatically
 


 Literals :- Representing fixed values
  Ex :-  1, 2.5, 'c' 

  Types Of Literals :-
    Integer :-
     - Numeric literal(Number) without any fractional or exponential part
     - Octal starts with 0 and hexadecimal starts with 0x
      octal       (base 8)  :- 021, 077 
      decimal     (base 10) :- 0, -8, 22
      Hexadecimal (base 16) :- 0x7f, 0x2a

    Floating :- Numeric literal that has either fractional or exponent form
     Ex :- -2.0, 0.00234, -0.22E-5 (E-5 = 10-5)

    Characters :- Single character inside single quotation marks
     Ex :- 'a', 'm', 'F', '2', '}'

    Escape Sequence :- Characters with backslashe which has special meaning
     Ex :-  
        \b - backspace      | \\ - Backslash              | \0 Null Character
        \f - formfeed       | \' - Single Quotation Mark  | \" - Double Quotation Mark
        \n - newline        | \r - return                 | \? - Quotation Mark    
        \t - Horizontal tab | \v - vertical tab

    String Literals :- Sequence of characters enclosed in double-quote marks 
     Ex :- "String" , "" ,  "    ", "S", 

    Constants :- Variable value cannot be changed once declared
     Ex :- const double PI = 3.14;
           #define LENGTH 10          - preprocessor 

    void :- Represents absence type



 Data Types :-
  - Determines type and size of data associated with variables
  - Type of data type determine how much space is occupies in storage
  
  Built-in :-1 byte = 8 bit, 1 kb = 1024 byte, 1mb = 1024kb    
    Type          Size     Range              Format Specifier    Example 
    char	       1 byte	−128 to 127         %c                  char test = 'B';
    short	       2 byte	−32,768 to 32,767                       short a = 10;
    int	         4 byte	−32,768 to 32,767   %d, %i              int id  = 0;            |  -5, 10;
    float	       4 byte                     %f                  float no = 22.442e2;    
    double	     8 byte                     %lf                 double no = 22.442e2;
    long int     8 byte                     %ld, %li            long a;
    long double	 16 byte                    %Lf                 long double d;
    unsigned int  4 byte	0 to 65,535       %u                  unsigned int x = 35;
    short int	                              %hd
    unsigned int	                          %u
    long int	                              %li
    long long int	                          %lli
    unsigned long int	                      %lu
    unsigned long long int	                %llu

   - Cannot declare void type variables
   - To Check size of variable use sizeof() operator Ex :- sizeof(variableName);
   - Signed and unsigned are type modifiers :-
      Signed   - allow for storage both positive and negative numbers
      Unsigned - allow for storage only positive numbers
 

  Derive Data Type :-
   - Derived from primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types
   Types :- Function, Arrays, Pointers, Reference

  User-Defined Data Types :-
   - Defined by user are called user-defined data types
   Types :- Class, Structure, Union, Enumeration, Typedef    



 Input Output(I/O) :-
  
  Output :-
   - printf() library function send formatted output on screen 
   - To use printf() library add :- #include<stdio.h> statement
   Ex :- printf("Bhavin") 

   - To print variable value use format specifier 
   Ex :- int no = 5; 
         float no1 = 10.10;
         double no2 = 20.202;
         char ch = 'B';
         printf(" %d  %f  %lf  %c  %s ",no, no1, no2, ch, "String");

  Input :-
   - scanf() function reads formatted input from the standard input such as keyboards
   Ex :- 
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
      int testInteger;
      float num1;
      double num2;
      char chr;
      scanf("%d", &testInteger);  // &testInteger get address of testInteger and user entered value stored in address
      scanf("%f %lf ", &num1 , &num2); // Multi-input from single line
      scanf("%c",&chr);   
      printf(" %d %f\n  %lf\n %c", testInteger, num1, num2, chr); 
      // When character is entered by user in above program, character itself is not stored
      // Instead an integer value (ASCII value) is stored
      return 0;
    }              


 
 Operator :- 
  - Operator is symbol that operates on value or variable
 
  Arithmetic :- Perform Mathematical operations
   Ex :- +, -, *, /, %(Reminder), ++, //

  Assignment Operator :- Used for assign value to variable
   Ex :- =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= , <<=, >>= , &=, ^= , |=

  Relational Operator :- If relation is true returns 1 otherwise false(0)
   Ex :- ==, >=, <=, !=, >, <

  Logical Operator :- Returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false
    && - Logical AND return true if both condition is true
    || - Logical OR return true if any condition is true
    !  - Logical NOT return true if operand is 0

  BitWise Operator :- Perform bit-level operation
    &	Bitwise AND         |  |	Bitwise OR   | ^	Bitwise exclusive OR
    ~	Bitwise complement  |  <<	Shift left   | >>	Shift right

  Comma Operator :- Link related expressions together
   Ex :- int a, c = 5, d;

  sizeof() Operator :-
   - Unary operator that return size of data (constants, variables, array, structure, etc.)
   - Format Specifier %zu is used to print value

  Unary operator :- Works with single operand 
   Ex :- ++, -- 

  Other Operator :-
   ?: Ternary operator     | &  Reference operator | *  Dereference operator | -> Member selection



 Storage Classes :-
  - Defines scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and function within Program
  Types :- auto, register, static, extern

   auto :- Default storage class for all variables
    Ex :- auto into st;
   
   register :- 
    - Used to define local variables that should be stored in register instead of RAM for quick access
    - Means variable has maximum size equal to register size (Usually one word)
    - Can't applied unary '&' operator on it
    - Does not means that variable stored in register it depends on hardware implementation
    Ex :- register int miles;

   static :-
    - initialized only once and destroyed when program completed its execution
    - Compiler keep variables till the end of program
    - default value is 0
    - When static used in global variable it one copy to be shared all objects of that class
    Ex :-  static int b = 8;
   
   extern :- Used to declare global variable or function in another file



Control Flow :- 

 Condition  :-
  If               :- if(expression){  //True code  }
  if...else        :- if(expression){  //True code  } else { //False code }
  if else ledder   :- if(expression){ //code } else if(expression){ //code } else { //False code}
  Nested If.. else :- if(expression){ if(expression){ //True code } else { //False code } } else{ //False code }
  Ternary          :- Condition ? True Code : False Code;     


 Loop :- 
  - Repeat block of code until specified condition is not false

  For Loop   :-  for(Initalization; Condition; Increment/Decrement){ //code }
  While Loop :-  while(expression){ //code  // Increment/Decrement } 
  Do..While  :-  do { //code // Increment/Decrement }while(expression)
   - Loop run at least one time in program
  


 Statement :-
  Break    :- Terminate loop immediately 
  Continue :- Skips current iteration of loop and continues with next iteration
 
  goto     :- 
   - Transfer Program control to specified label
   - label is identifier When goto statement is encountered, 
   - Control of program jumps to label: and starts executing code
   Syntax :- 
    goto label;
    label:
    statement;  
            
         

 Switch Case :-
  - Allow variable to be tested against list of values
  - Expression used in switch statement must have an integral or enumerated type
  - expression is evaluated once and compared with values of each case label
  - If there is match, corresponding statements after matching label are executed otherwise default statements executed
  - Default statement is optional

  Syntax :- 
   switch(expression){
      case constant1:
        // Statement   
        break; 
                
      case constant2:
        // Statement   
        break; 

      default:
        // Statement
   } 



Function :-
 - Block of code that perform specific task
 - Every program must have main() function
 - Function declaration tells compiler about function name, return type and parameters
 - function definition provides actual function body
 
 Syntax :-
  return_type function_name(Parameter list){
      // function body
  }

 Call function :- function_name(Parameter) 

 Function Call by Value :- Passing function arguments value
 Function Call by Reference :- Passing function arguments address



Array :-
 - Used to Store collection of same type data in contiguous manner in fixed-size memory
 - Array elements accessible via its index

 Example Array :- 
  - type array_name[arraysize];  // Size must be Integer
  - int arr[10];                 // One-Dimensional array
  - int arr[3] = {1,2,3};        // Initializing array 
  - arr[2] = 2;                  // Initializing array 
  - If element is greater than array size ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Throw
  - int access_arr = arr[1];     // Access array element 
  
  - int multi_arr[5][10];        // Two-Dimensional array - [Row][Column]
  - int multi_arr[5][10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13};
  - int val = multi_arr[2][5];

  - int multi_arr[5][10][4]      // Multi-Dimensional array - [Row][Column][Dimension]

 

 Passing Array as Function Arguments :- void myFunc(int *param)   |    (int param[10])    |   (int param[])

 Return Array From Function :- int * myFunc()    



Pointer :-
 - Every variable has location and every location has its address which can be accessed using ampersand (&) Operator
 - Pointer is variable whose value is the address of another variable
 Syntax :- type *variable_name;
 - * asterisk sign used to declare variable as pointer
 Example :- 
  int var = 10;
  int *ip; or int *ip = NULL; // Null pointer 0 value
  ip = &var; 
  printf("Access Value of Pointer variable", *ip); //10 - Normal ip print address and &var print var address

 
 Pointer Arithmetic :- ++, --, +, - 
  Example :- 1000 | 1004

 Pointer Comparsion :- >, <, == 

 Array of Pointer :- 
  - int *ptr[variable] or int *ptr[10,20,30]
  - ptr[i] = &var[i]
  - *ptr[i]            or ptr[i] 

 Pointer to Pointer :-
  - First pointer store address of second pointer and second pointer store address of variable
  Example :-
   int var = 30;
   int *ptr;
   int **pptr;
   ptr = &var
   pptr = &ptr
