File System and DiskScheduling :-
 
File System :-
 - File System manage how data permanently stored, managed and fetched implemented as multi-leveled system
 - Folder(Directory) is collection of related files
 - File System mapping data on sector(Divide file logically and stored or fetched stored files) 
 - Disk block Logical representation of smallest unit of disk that OS divided logical partition into single blocks
 Diagram :- Disk --> File System --> User View  | 1 block ==> 1 to 2 Disk Sector

 Allocation method :- Contiguous | Linked | Indexed
 
 Types of OS and its File System :-
  Windows, NTFS/FAT32  |  DOS, FAT  |  UNIX, Unix  |  Linux,  EXT2,3,4  |  MacOS, HFS+  |  BigData, zfs,Data Wide 

 Architecture :-
  Application Program 
  Logical File System        [ Manages Metadata ]                      [Logical Block Address]
  File Organization Module   [ Allocation and Free space management ]  [Physical Block Address]
  I/O Control
  Disk

 File/Directory Structure :-
  Single-level directory   :- One folder, all file inside this Folder | Name Unique |  Distgenius for multiple users
  Two-level directory      :- Different user have different folder 
  Tree Structure Directory :- Root directory have different directory, sub directory etc..



File Attributes & Operations :-
 Operation :- Creating |  Reading  |  Writing  |  Deleting  | Truncating - Delete entire file only not attribute
  
 Attribute :- Meta Data of file
  Name  |  Extension(Type)  |  Author  |  Date  |  Size  |  Permission  |  Compression  |  Location 
  Creation, Modified, Accessed  |  Protection(Encryption)  



File Allocation Method :-
 - Achieve Efficient Disk Utilization with faster data access

 Contiguous Allocation :-
  - Store file block contiguous and block-size dependent on hard-disk block size
  - Easy to implement and Excellent Read Performance 
  - Disk become fragmented and Difficult to increase file size
  
  Access :- Sequential, Random/Direct
  
  Example :- File-Allocation Table
   FileName  Start Block No.  No.of Blocks(Length)
    A             0                3
    B             6                5
    C             14               4

          Disk 
    0  1  2  3  4  5      A(0-3)
    6  7  8  9  10 11     B(6-10)
    12 13 14 15 16 17     C(14-17)
   

 Non-Contiguous Allocation :-

  Linked-List Allocation :- 
   - Use pointer to identify Next-BlockAddress and In last -1 
   - Remove external fragmentation, file size can increase
   - Large Seek Time, Random/Direct Access Difficult, Overhad of Pointers

   Example :- 
    File  Start   
    F1     2       

        Disk 
    0  1  2  3  4  5    F1(2,9)  
    6  7  8  9  10 11   F1(9,11)  
    12 13 14 15 16 17   F1(11,-1)  


  Indexed Allocation :-
   - Create one index block of file that give information of entire file block
   Access :- Direct, Sequential 
   - No external fragmentation but internal  |  Pointer overhead due to Multi-level index
   
   Example :- File-A
    File  Index Block
     F1     2       
       Disk 
    0  1  2  3  4  5    B1(2)
    6  7  8  9  10 11   B2(9)(IB6 - Give other block information for access) 
    12 13 14 15 16 17   B3(12)  

  
 Unix I-node Structure :- 
  - Index node data structure in Unix describe file-system object such as file or directory
  - Each inode store Attributes(Metadata) and Direct Block Location(Store Pointer that directly point to data block)
  - No. of inode limit total number of files/directories that stored in file system

  I-node infomation :-
   - Administrative Information(Permission, Time-Stamp etc...)
   - No. of direct blocks(Typically-12) that contain first 12 blocks of file
   - Single Indirect Block -> Data block(Not give data) -> Give Pointer(Address) -> Which bring data block
   - Double Indirect Block -> Data Block -> Pointer -> Data Block (2) -> Finally Give Data
   - Triple Indirect Block -> Data Block -> Pointer -> Data Block (2) -> Pointer -> Data Block (3) -> Finally Give Data 
 

 Question :-
  - Unix inode contain 8 direct block addresses, one indirect block, one double and one triple indirect block
  - Size of each disk block is 128byte and size of each block address is 8Byte
  - Find maximum file size?
   
  BlockSize = 128
  Total No. Of pointer in one Disk Block = 128/8 = 16(2^4) 
  Pointer -> (8(DB) + 16(SI) + (16x16)(DI) + (16x16x16)(TI)) x 128   
          =  8(1 + 2 + 2x16 + 2x16x16) x 128
          =  8(35+512)x 128
          =  8(547)x128 (128X8 = 1024KB)
          =  547 KB    



Hard-Disk Architecture :-
 - Disk addressed large one-dimensional array of logical block
 - One-dimensional array of logical blocks has to be mapped onto physical Sector
 - Cylinder -> Track -> Sector 
 
 Storage :-
  uniform bit density     - More sector on outer tracks
  non-uniform bit density - Same number of sector on all tracks

 Disk Architecture :-
  - Platter(Circle Shape) has upper and lower-level surface with Read-Write head that connect ActuatorArm to find data
  - Read-Write head movement either in forward or backward only 
  - On Platter surface tracks that has fix no. of sector where store data 
  - Sector addressable unit of disk
  - Collection of consecutive sectors known as Cluster
  - Collection of track of same radius from all surface known as Cylinder and content in disk store in cylinder-wise
  Spindal(Vertical Stick) :- Connect Platter to move either in clock-wise or anti-clock-wise undirectional
  -  To reach data -> Platter -> Surface(Upper/Lower) -> Track ->  Sector -> Data
 
 Formula :-
  DiskSize     = P x S x T x S x D
  Address size = log x 2 (Ns) - Bits
  No. of sector(NS)= 2 * P * T * No. of sectors per track
  Sector Capacity  = 2 * No. of Platter * No. of Tracks Per Surface * No. of Sector per track * 1 Sector Capacity 



Disk Access Time :-
 Seek Time        :- Time taken by R/W head to reach desired track
 Rotation Time    :- Time taken by one full rotation(360)
 Rotation Latency :- Time taken to reach desired track(Half of Rotation Time)
 Sector/Transfer Time :- Data To be transfer/ Transfer rate;
  Transfer rate(Data Rate) = No. of Heads x Capacity of one track x No. of rotation in one second
  Total DiskTime         :- Seek Time + Rotation Latency + 1 Sector/Transfer Time
  Avg. Rotation Latency  :- 1 Disk Rotation time / 2
  1 Sector/Transfer Time :- 1 Disk Rotation time / No. of sectors per track
 
 
 Question :-
  Disk with 16 Platter, 2 Surface per track, 1k Tracks per surface, 2k Sectors per track, 2048 bytes per sector
  Disk Rotates with 3000 RPM | Seek time 10ms
  - Find Disk Capacity?
  - Number of bits required for addressing disk?
  - Find Disk Access time?
  - Find Disk Transfer time?

  1) 2 * 16 * 1k * 2k * 2kb = 2^37B = 128GB 
  2) 2 * 16 * 1k * 2k = 2^26B = 26bits
  3) 10ms + 20ms/2 + 20ms/2k =  20.01 msec 



Disk Partition :-
 Low-Level Partition :- Creating track and sector by Manufacturer
 
 High-Level Partition(Logical) :- 
  - Drive partition by User using OS
  - Make more than one primary partition for different OS because it Not possible to store 2 OS in single Partition
  Two Types :- Primary(OS and user file Stored)  |  Extended(Only user file stored)

 

Free space Management :-  
 Free List     :- Linked List of all free blocks                                                 
 Bitmap Method :- N blocks in disk => n-bit into^n => if bit is 0 block is free if 1 is occupied
 - Free list size is variable where as bitmap size is constant



Disk Scheduling Algorithm :-
 Disk bandwidth :- Number of byte transferred / Time between first request and last service 
 - To minimize seek time
 - FCFS And SSIF not required direction while SCAN and LOOK Required
 Request Queue :- 
  - Whenever user request, data stored in particular track after mapping it, whatever track number come insert in queue
  
 Seek Time = (No. of head Movement * 1 Head Movement time) + Extra Delay  
 

 FCFS(First Come First Serve) :-
  - No StarVation(Every Request gets fair chance) | No indefinite PostPonement
  - Performance without looking data request(Seek time higher)

  Question :- 
   - Disk contatin 200 tracks(0-199) request queue contain track no. 82, 170, 140, 24, 16, 190 respectively
     current poistion of R/W head=50 calculate total no. of tracks movement by R/W head using FCFS?
      0       50             199(Cylinder)
                82
                      170               
            43
                  140
         24
       16                                      
                         190  

  
  Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
   (82-50) + (170-82) + (170-43) + (140-43) + (140-24) + (24-16) + (190-16)   # Track No - Last R/W
   OR (170-50) + (170-43) + (140-43) + (140-16) + (190-16)               # One Direction Last - To last Direction R/W 
   = 32  +  88  +  127  +  97  +  116  +  8  +  174    
   = 642



 SSIF(Shortest Seek Time First) :-
  - Reach desired track which has least of seek time means nearest of 50(R/W poistion)
  - Give optimal result(Shortest Seek Time)
  - Response time decrease | Throughput increase
  - StarVation occur
  - Overhead because find every time nearest poistion so required check entire list which increase complexity


  Question :- 
   - Disk contatin 200 tracks(0-199) request queue contain track no. 82,170, 140, 24, 16, 190 respectively
     current poistion of R/W head =50 calculate total no. of tracks movement by R/W head using SSIF?
   - If R/W head take 1 nanosecond to move from one track to another then total time taken?

                     170
                        190


  Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
     (50-16) + (190-16)  # R/W - Last most distance
    =  34    +   174     
    =  208



 SCAN(Elevator) :- 
  - Move in one direction till last point(199) and other direction stop last request point
  - Once change direction and request occurs dynamically then can't go back 
  - Direction to larger value
  - High Throughput | Low Variance in Response time 
  - Long waiting for some request


  Question :- 
   - Disk contatin 200 tracks(0-199) request queue contain track no. 82,170, 140, 24, 16, 190 respectively
     current poistion of R/W head =50 calculate total no. of tracks movement by R/W head using SCAN?
   - If R/W head takes 1nanosecond to move from one track to another then total time taken?  :- 332 x 1ns = 332  
    0       50           199

          43
        24
      16              


  Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
    (199-16) + (199-50)  # Go one-direction till end
   =  183     +   149     
   =  332


 
 C-SCAN(Circular-Scan) :-
  - Move in one direction till last point(199) and other direction till last point then last request point
  - (50 --> 199 Nofill --> 0 - then fill last request)
  - Provide uniform waiting time

  Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
    (199-50) + (199-0) + (43-0)
   =  174    +   199   +  43
   =  391 



 LOOK :- 
  - Not move till last direction move only till last request   
  (190-16) + (190-50)   # Highest Last Point - Direction
  =  174     +   140     
  =  314



 C-LOOK(Circular LOOK) :-
  (50-fill --> last-request(190) --> 16(lowest-request) --> Then fill last-request)
  (190-50) + (190-16) + (43-16)
   = 341
