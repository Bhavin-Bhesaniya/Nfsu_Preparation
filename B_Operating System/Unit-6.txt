Disk Scheduling :-

Hard-Disk Architecture :-
 Platter (Circle Shape)  :
  - Every Platter has two surfaces upper-level and lower-level
  - On Platter surface there is read-write head which are connected through actuator arm to use fetch and read data
  - Read-Write head movement either in forward or backward only 
  - On Platter surface there are tracks 
  - Every track has fix no. of sectors where we put our data 
  - To reach data -> Platter -> Surface(Upper/Lower) -> Track ->  Sector -> Data
  - Every platter has Read-Write head which connect with Actuator Arm to find data
   Formula DiskSize : P x S x T x S x D
 
 Spindal(Vertical Stick) : Connect Platter to move either in clock-wise or anti-clock-wise undirectional



Disk Access Time :-
 Seek Time        :- Time taken by R/W head to reach desired track
 Rotation Time    :- Time taken by one full rotation(360)
 Rotation Latency :- Time taken to reach desired track(Half of Rotation Time)
 Transfer Time    :- Data To be transfer/ Transfer rate;
                     Transfer rate(Data Rate) = {No. of Heads x Capacity of one track x No. of rotation in onse second } 



Disk Scheduling Algorithm :-
 - To minimize seek time
 - FCFS And SSIF not required direction while SCAN and LOOK Required
 
 

FCFS(First Come First Serve) :-
  Request Queue : Every disk have request queue whenever user create request for data that data in what particular track stored in memory
                  management after mapping it, whatever track no comes it inserts in queue number  
  - No StarVastion(Request is waiting for its tern to work) in algorithm
  - Performance without looking data request(Seek time higher)

  Question :- A disk contatins 200 tracks(0-199) request queue contain track no. 82,170, 140, 24, 16, 190 respectively
              current poistion of R/W head =50 calculate total no. of tracks movement by R/W head using FCFS?

              0             50                  199
                                82
                                        170               
                        43
                                    140
                    24
                16                                        
                                             190  

    Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
        (82-50) + (170-82) + (170-43) + (140-43) + (140-24) + (24-16) + (190-16)  OR (170-50) + (170-43) + (140-43) + (140-16) + (190-16)
      =  32     +   88     +  127     +   97     +  116     +   8     +   174    
      = 642



SSIF(Shortest Seek Time First) :-
  - Least of seek time to reach desired track means nearest of 50(R/W poistion)
  - Gives optimal result(Shortest Seek Time)
  - Response time is average
  - StarVation occurs because some time one request wait for long-time
  - Overhad generate because we need to find every time nearest poistion so we need to check entire list which increase complexity

  
  Question :- A disk contatins 200 tracks(0-199) request queue contain track no. 82,170, 140, 24, 16, 190 respectively
              current poistion of R/W head =50 calculate total no. of tracks movement by R/W head using SSIF?
            - If R/W head is takes 1nanosecond to move from one track to another then total time taken?

      =  34     +   174     
      =  208
  


SCAN :-
  - Also known as Elevator algorithm
  - Move in one direction till last point(199) and other direction stop last request point
  - It moves till becaus if dynamically request come
  - Once you change direction and request occurs dynamically then you can't go back

      =  183     +   149     
      =  332



LOOK :- 
  - Not move till direction only last request   
  Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
      (190-16) + (190-50)
      =  174     +   140

CSCAN(Circular Scan) :-
  - Move in one direction till last point(199) and other direction stop last request point
  - than move to another direction till last point without fulfill any request(50-fill-199-nofill-0-fill last request)
  Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
      (199-50)   + (199-0) + (43-0)
      =  174     +   199   + 43

CLOOK(Circular LOOK) :-
  - (50 - fill  - last-request(190) - Nofill  - 16(lowest-request) - fill last-request)
  Find track movement Or Howmany time direction change :-
      (190-50)   + (190-16) + (43-16)
