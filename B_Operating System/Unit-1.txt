What is OS?
 - System Program that act as interface between user and computer hardware 
 - It Control execution of all kinds of programs and manage all resources of computer system
 - First OS is ATLAS developed by Tom Kilburn professoor at Manchester University in 1962 
 - Provide environment in which user can execute its program 
 
 Primary Goals :- Windows | Mac : Machintosh  
  Convenience : Use Easiet way to any hardware 
  Efficiency  : Use System resources efficiently
  Throughput  : Number of tasks executed per unit time  (Linux)
  Portability : Any hardware can run OS 
  Reliability :
  Scalbility  : Update features 
  Robutness   : If any error is encountered, solve error problem

OS Duties | Function | Services | Features :- 

 Resource Management | Resource Governance:-
  - Manage all kinds of resources both hardware and software using Schedulers to achieve parallel processing


 Process Management | Process Execution :-
  - Load program into memory, execute it in CPU and Handle it using various CPU Scheduling
  - Also Provide mechanism for process synchronization, Inter Process Communication(IPC) and Deadlock handling 


 Storage/File management or Manipulation:-
  - Support Storage allocation, Disk scheduling using File System and Manage all file operation based on permission mode
  - Data stores in various tracks of Hard disks that all managed by storage manager
  - NTFS(New Technology File System) | NFS(Network File System)
  - CFS(Clustered File System)       | CIFS(Common Internal File System)


 Memory management :-
  - Keep track of memory to identify which part being used by which Job(Process) 
  - Allocating and deallocating memory space of Primary(Main) Memory because size limits


 Protection, Security & Privacy management :-
  - Control access to system resources to Ensure that external I/O devices are protected from invalid access attempt
  - Windows use Kerberos Security Protocol
  

 I/O Device Management | I/O Operation :-
  - Keep tracks of all devices and Manage device communication between User and Device via their respective drivers 
  - Program that responsible for this task is known as I/O controller


 Communication :-
  - Implemented by two methods either by Shared Memory or by Message Passing
  - Handle routing, connection strategies
  - Processes on one computer or on different computers but they are connected through computer network


 Error Handling | Error detection :-
  - OS constantly checks errors and takes appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing     




What is Kernel? Different OS Structure Type & Kernel Architecture :-  
 - Acts as bridge between application and data processing that performed at hardware level using system call
 - Shell is interface that helps to access kernel core features
 Type of Shell :- Command-line | Batch(Command Collection) | GUI

 Objectives of Kernel :
  - Establish communication between user level application and hardware
  - Decide state of incoming processes
  - Control disk management, memory management, task management
 

 Monolithic Architecture :-   
  - Entire OS working in kernel space so execution is fast and process run completely in single address space
  - It is static single binary file
  - Kernel provides various services using system calls
  - If single service fails its lead to entire system failure and to add new services entire architecture needs to modify
  Example :- MS DOS, Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400


 Layered Architecture :-
  - OS broken into number of layers (levels) where every layer has different functionality
  - Bottom layer (layer 0) is hardware and topmost layer (layer N) is user interface
  - Each layer can only uses function of lower level layer
  - Change in one layer specification does not affect rest of layers
  - Layer 1 to 6:- Hardware, CPU Scheduling, Memory Management, Process Management, I/O Buffer, User Program
  Example :- Windows NT

    
 Microkernel Architecture :-  
  - Kernel is broken down into separate processes, known as servers
  - Some servers run in kernel space and other in user-space
  - Servers invoke "services" from each other by sending messages via IPC 
  - If one server fails, other servers can still work efficiently. 
  - New services added in user space and does not require kernel to be modified which increased security and stability
  - All kernel components live in a common shared address space Therefore no protection between OS and drivers 
  Example :- MacOS, Windows NT, Mach, L4, AmigaOS, Minix, K42


 Modular Architecture :-
  - System parts allocated as independent files called modules which added to system at run time
  - Requires small amount of time for load modules
  

 Hybrid Kernel :-
  - Combination of both monolithic and mircrokernel 
  - Use speed and design of monolithic, modularity and stability of microkernel
  Example :- Windows NT, Netware, BeOS




System Call :-
 - To use system functionality we need to go in kernel mode because we only can access user mode
 - System call is mechanism using which user program request kernel to access all system functionalities 

 Dual-mode operation :-
  - User mode 
  - Kernel mode | supervisor mode | system mode | privileged mode 
  Mode bit :-  Kernel : 0 | User : 1

  Example :- 
    User Mode                                                                      Mode Bit = 1
      User Process Executing --> Get System Call \                / Return From System Call
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    \ 0      1 /(Return Mode Bit-1)
    Kernel Mode                                 Execute System Call                 Mode Bit = 0 


 Type of System Call :- 
  E.x. :- Fork, exec, getpid, getppid, wait, exit
  File                        :- Open, read, write, close, create file
  Device                      :- Read, write, Repoisition, 
                                iocte(manipulates underlying device parameter of special files) 
                                fcnte (access point for several advanced operations on file descriptors)
  Security                    :- chmod(Chagen Privilege Mode), umask
  Process Control             :- load, abort, execute, fork, wait, signal, allocate
  Information                 :- getpid, attribute, get system data
  Inter-Process Communication :- Pipe, shmget(Get Shared Memory), create/delete connection
  
  Fork :-
   - In UNIX Fork() Create child process of parent process
   - Returns process ID which is generally process id of child process
   - Return value 0 :- Child process , 1 :- Parent process, -1 : if child process not created
   - Formula :- 2N-1 (Parent process) | 2N (Child process)

  Exec :- exec replace current process with another (different) one

  Wait :-
   - Used by parent process to determine termination of child process
   - Parent process uses Wait() system call and gets exit status of child process as well as PID of child process 
     which is terminated 
 



Types of OS :– 
  Single process   :- MS DOS    1981
  Multiprogramming :- Dijkstra  1960
  Multitasking     :- CTSS, MIT 1960


 Batch Operating System | Batch Processing :- 
  - Set Similar kind of process(job) in same batch in First Come First Served(FCFS) manner for execution
  - When Job request for I/O at time CPU is Idle which is major disadvantages (Non-Preemption)
  - IBM create FORTRAN Alone with IBSYS 709X in 1960 
   
  Example :-
    User ---> Set Job in ROM device ---> Go to operator ---> Operator group similar job and execute  
    ---> One time one process execute (No particular time for output) 
    ---> Output is write to disk and get to user from operator
    ---> User use output in own system for process  



 Multi-programming :- IDLENESS
  - Increases CPU utilization by keeping multiple jobs(process) in main memory so that CPU always has one to execute
  - It is NonPre-emptive scheduling means if one process give cpu, cpu execute entire process completely and 
    only after completation of process, pick another process
  - Sometime cpu go for I/O operation at time cpu will pick another process from job pull So cpu IDLE time is zero   



 Multi-tasking | Time-Sharing :- Responsiveness
  - Sharing small portion of time or time quantum among multiple processes by CPU Scheduling 
  - CPU executes multiple process using switching which Reduce CPU IDLE time
  - It is pre-emptive means Each process has given particular time in which it complete execution otherwise it will
    be switching(Context Switch) to another process by CPU Scheduling but process still available if not complete
    in within given time
  - Due to its fast switching Security arise with program data, data communication and its reliability 
  - Response time should be minimal
  Ex :- Multics, Unix



 Multi-Processing :-
  - In uni-processor system, only one process execute at time
  - Computer have more than one processor its called multiprocessing so multiple processes executed simultaneously
    to achieve Parallel processing 
  - Multiple processors share computer bus, sometimes clock, memory and peripheral device
  - Used to get more work done in shorter period of time, increased reliability
  Types :- Tightly Bound(Shared memory) | Loosely Bound(Distributed System)



 Multi-Threading :-
  - Single process have multiple code segment(threads) so it running concurrently within "Context" of that process
  - Increase Responsiveness, less costly
    
  

 Real-Time operating System(RTOS):-
  - Fixed time Constraint system where time constraint matter lot and can't be delays
  - Time taken by system to respond input and display required updated information is termed as response time   
  - VxWorks, QNX & RTLinux are RTOS and Palm OS is mobile operating system for Personal Digital Assistant(PDA) 
  Example :- Embedded systems, Robotics, Scientific utilities, etc.
    
  Types :-
   Hard-Real Time System :- Critical tasks needs to complete on time there no place for delays 
   Soft-Real Time System :- Less restrictive with limited utility than hard-real time system



 Distributed Operating System | Cluster :-
  - Multiple Processors serve Multiple applications to multiple users using Central Processor
  - Processor communicate with each other through various communication lines like network connection which referred
    as loosely coupled
  - OS distribute computation logics among several physical processors
  - Processors not share memory instead each processor has its own local memory, storage etc...
  - Reduction of delays in processing and loading on host computer
  - Availability, Load balancing, Scalability     
  - If Processors connect with local network(Single network) like Single server it is called "Cluster Operating System"
  Ex :- Locus



 Embedded System :-
  - Work on fixed machine like A.C.
  - You can't customally change its functionality  



 Network Operating System :-
  - Runs on server computer and provide server capability to manage application, user data and other functionality
  - Purpose to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in network
    typically local area network (LAN), private network or to other networks
  - Centeralized Server so security manage and software upgrade easily and enable remote access 
  - Dependency on central server, High cost, Regular maintenance and update are some disadvantages
  Ex :- Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD




Spooling(Simultaneous Peripheral Operations Online) :- 
 - Different Pheripheral devices(I/O Device) can run simultaneously 
 - Provide buffer area in secondary memory to save CPU time and user not need to wait for I/O process




What is Booting & What happens when we turn on computer? BIOS VS UEFI | MBR vs GPT :-  
 - Process of loading OS 
 - When computer power is turned on, cpu move to BIOS which stored in EPROM to perform start-up procedure
 - BIOS run POST(power-on self test) process which check all hardware if any error beeps are hered which known as 
   POST beep codes
 - BIOSes following ACPI(Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) create tables that describing devices and manage
   power in computer 
 - On POST process successful BIOS load MBR(Master Boot Record) to RAM
 - MBR load bootstrap loader which load OS, Kernel and much more in RAM
 - init is last step of kernel boot sequence which decied inital state of OS
 - In Linux its called GRUB(GRand Unified Bootloader) OR LLIO(Linux Loader-default)
  
 Types of booting :- 
  Hard Booting - Power On system
  Soft Booting - Restart / Ctrl + Alt + Del twice


 BIOS VS UEFI :-
  - Both boot pc before booting OS but UEFI is modern solution
  - CMOS(Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) used for battery-backed memory where BIOS stores various setting on
    motherboard which replaced with flash memory (also referred to as EEPROM)
  - MS-DOS PCs released in 1980s had BIOS
  - BIOS has limited functionality like boot upto 2.1 TB, run in 16bit processor mode and 1 MB of space to execute
  - In 2007 PC Manufacturer agreed for UEFI 
  - UEFI Firmware can boot drive 2.2 TB Or larger and use GPT Partition Scheme
  - UEFI can run in 32-bit or 64-bit processor mode and has more address space to execute
    

 MBR VS GPT(GUID Partition Table) :-
  - Partition structure define how information is structured on partition and used during startup if partition bootable
  - GPT is newer standard with many advantages while MBR for compatibility 
  - MBR introduced by IBM in 1983 which located in beginning of drive that contain bootloader for installed OS
  - If linux OS than GRUB Bootloader located in MBR
  - MBR works with upto 2TB and supports upto 4 primary partitions
  - GPT associated with UEFI and GUID Partition Table provide every partition ondrive has globally unique identifier
  - GPT allow upto 128 partition and store multiple copices of bootloader
  - GPT Provide cyclic redundancy check(CRC) to check data is corrupted or not to recover data


 NTFS VS ETL VS FAT32 VS exFAT :-
  - NTFS(New Technology File System) use with windows by default
  - EFL(Extensible Firmware Interface) usually harddisk drive or solid-state drive that used by computer having UEFI 
  - FAT(File Allocation Table 32) 
  - exFAT(Extended File Allocation Table)



RAM(Random Access Memory) Vs ROM (Read-Only Memory):-
 Ram :-
  - Volatile, Faster, loading OS and executing program
  - For 32-bit Max Ram size :- 4 GB AND 64 : 16GB 
  Types :- 
   DRAM  - Dynamic RAM must be continuously refreshed otherwise all contents are lost
   SRAM  - Static RAM is faster, needs less power, more expensive but need to be refreshed like DRAM
   SDRAM - Synchronous Dynamic RAM run at very high clock speeds
   DDR   – Double Data Rate  Provide synchronous Access Memory

 ROM :- 
  - Non-volatile so Write once read any no. of time
  - Used in start-up process of computer
  Types :- 
   PROM   :- Programmable ROM type of ROM is written or programmed only once
   EPROM  :- Erasable Programmable ROM reprogrammable using ultraviolet light
   EEPROM :- Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM using electric charge(Flash Memory) 
   MASKROM :- Content programmed only by integrated circuit manufacturer
