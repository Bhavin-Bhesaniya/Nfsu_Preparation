I/O Management :-
 - Two main responsibility of computer :- Process and I/O
 - Some process perform more I/O and Minimal Processing
 - I/O devices vary widely in function and speed

 - I/O Subsystem of the kernel separate rest of kernel from complexities of managing I/O Device
 - Device drivers provide uniform device access interface to i/o subsystem
 Diagram :-
                      Kernel                        # 1 to 3 Software
                Kernel I/O Subsystem
    Device Driver-1     ... Device Driver-N
    Device Controller-1 ... Device Controller -N    # Hardware
        Device 1            Device - N


 Types of devices :-
  Storage         :- Disk | USB
  Transmission    :- Modem
  Human-Interface :- Keyboard | Mouse | Display
  Specialized     :- Microscope | Telescope 


 Hardware :-
  Port :- 
   - Connection point where device is connected
   - I/o port consists of :- Status Register | Control Register | Data-in/Out Register 
  
  Bus  :- Set of wires to transfer data and control information
  Controller :- Control port on device


 Modes of Performing I/O :-
  - Polling(Busy-waiting)  |  Interrupt  | DMA (Burst | Cycle Stealing | Direct Virtual Memory Access(DVMA))


 Complementary Devices :-
  - Teletype = Keyboard + Display   |   Photocopier = Scanner + Printer
 

 Virtual Devices :- PDF Printer


 Properties of Device :-
  - Character-Stream versus block
  - Sequential access versus Random access
  - Synchronization versus asynchronous
  - Sharable versus Dedicated
  - Speed
  - Read-only, Write-only, Read-Write


 Service I/O System :-
  - I/O Scheduling  |  Buffering  |  Caching  |  Error Handling  |  I/O Protection  |  Spooling
