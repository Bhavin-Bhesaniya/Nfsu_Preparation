User Administration :-
 
 Types of User :- 
  Root / superuser :- Run any command without any restriction assumed as system administrator
  System account   :- Needed for operation of system-specific component | Ex :- Mail account | sshd account 
  
  User account :-
   - Provide interactive access to system for users and groups of users 
   - Limited access to critical system files and directories
   - Unix support Group Account which logically groups number of accounts 
   - Every account would be part of another group account 
  

 Managing Users and Groups :- 
  passwd - Keep user account and password  | Hold majority information about account on Unix system
  shadow - Hold encrypted password of corresponding account, Not all systems support this file
  group  - Group information for each account
  gshadow - Secure group account information
 
  useradd  - Add account to system
  usermod  - Modifies account attributes
  userdel  - Delete account from system
  groupadd - Adds group to system
  groupmod - Modifies group attributes
  groupdel - Remove group from system
  

 Create Group :-
  - All groups listed in /etc/groups file
  - Default groups are system account specific group and its not recommended to use them for ordinary account 
  Syntax :- groupadd groupname
 

 Create Account :- useradd accountname
 Modify Account :- usermod - Make changes to existing account from command line
 Delete Account :- userdel - Delete existing user



System Logging :-
 - Unix syslog is host-configurable use centralized system logging process that run /etc/syslogd or /etc/syslog
 - /etc/syslog.conf file Control messages that logged 
 
 Facility - Application or process that submitted log message
 Priority - Level defined within syslog as guidelines from debugging information to critical event
 Selector - Combination of one or more facilities and level | When incoming event match selector action performed
 Action   - Write message to log file, echo message to console or other device, write message to logged in user or 
            send message along to another syslog server

 
 Syslog Facilities :- 
  auth  - Activity related to requesting name and password (getty, su, login)
  cron  - System scheduler
  ftp   - Ftp daemon
  kern  - Kernel messages
  lpr   - line printing system
  mail  - Mail system
  mark  - Pseudo-event used to generate timestamp in log files
  news  - Network news protocol (nnp)
  ntp   - Network time protocol 
  user  - Regular user processes
  uucp  - UUCP subsystem
  console  - Capture messages that generally directed to system console
  daemon   - System daemon catch-all
  authpriv - Same as auth but logged to file that only read by selected users
  local0.local7 - Local facilities defined per site

 
 Syslog Priorities :- 
  crit   - Hardware error
  err    - Ordinary error
  info   - Informational message
  none   - Specify not to log messages
  emerg  - System crash usually broadcast to all users
  alert  - Corrupted system database
  debug  - Messages used when debugging programs
  notice   - Condition that not error but possibly handled in special way
  Warning  - Warning

  - Each program send its messages dutifully to system logger,  logger makes decision on what to keep track of and
    what to discard based on levels defined in selector
  - When you specify level system keep track of everything at that level and higher


 Logger Command :-
  - Deal with system logging | Send logging messages to syslogd daemon and provokes system logging
  Syntax :- logger message
 
 Log Rotation   :- Log files consume large disk space bcz grow | Use tool newsyslog or logrotate using cron daemon  
 Log Location   :- System application create their log files in /var/log and its sub-directories 
 Logging Action :- Log message to file | Send message to all user(*) 
   


Signals and Traps :-
 - Signals are software interrupts sent to program to indicate that important event occurred like error
 Ctrl+C - SIGINT sent to script to terminate process
 kill   - $ kill -signal pid
 Dump core       :- Containing memory image of process when it received signal
 Default Action  :- Terminate/Stop process | Ignore signal | Continue stopped process | Sending Signal 
 Trapping Signal :- trap command signals   | Used to Clean up temporary files | Ignore signal

 Types of signal :-
  SIGHUP	  1	   Detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
  SIGINT	  2	   User send interrupt signal (Ctrl + C)
  SIGQUIT	  3	   User send quit signal (Ctrl + D)
  SIGFPE    8	   Issued if illegal mathematical operation attempted
  SIGKILL   9	   Must quit immediately not perform any clean-up operation
  SIGALRM	  14	 Alarm clock signal (used for timers)
  SIGTERM	  15	 Software termination signal (sent by kill by default)
