File Management :-  Data -> File -> Directories -> File System   
 Directory Structure :-
  - Hierarchical structure with root (/) at base of file system and all other directories spreading from there
  - Each file or directory is uniquely identified by inode
  - Root directory has inode number 2 and lost+found directory has inode number of 3 while 0 and 1 not used 
  - File inode number seen by specifying -i option to ls command

   
 Directory Files :-
  /     - Root directory contain only directories needed at top level of file structure
  /bin  - Executable files
  /dev  - Device drivers
  /etc  - Supervisor directory commands, disk and other configuration files, valid user list and send critical message
  /lib  - Shared library files and other kernel-related file
  /boot - Booting system file
  /home - Home directory for users and other accounts
  /mnt  - Mount temporary file system such as cdrom and floppy for CD-ROM drive and floppy diskette drive respectively
  /proc - All processes marked as file by process number or other information that dynamic to system
  /tmp  - Hold temporary files used between system boot
  /usr  - Used for miscellaneous purposes used by many users 
        - Include administrative command, shared files, library files, and other
  /var  - Variable-length files such as log that contain variable amount of data
  /sbin - Binary(executable) files for system administration   |  Ex :- fdisk and ifconfig utlities
  /kernel - Kernel files
  


 Types of files :-
  Ordinary Files      :- Contain data, text, or program instruction 
  Special Files       :- Provide access to hardware 
  Directories(Folder) :- Store both special and ordinary file 



 File/Directory command :-

  *     - Matching any filename
  ?     - Matching any character
  TAB   - Try to complete filename
  ~     - Home directory
  od    - Display binary file content

  ls dirname       :- To list files in directory
  cd dirname       :- Changing Directories

  more filename    :- Browse file from beginning to end
  mv olddir newdir :- Rename Directories
  rm filename      :- Remove file
  .(dot)           :- Filename .(dot) represent current working directory
  ..(dot dot)      :- Represent directory one level above current working directory(Parent directory)
  umount           :- unmount(remove) file system from system
  mount - To see what currently mounted (available for use) (in order to be usable by system)
  /mnt  - Temporary mount(CDROM drives, remote network drives, floppy drives) located 
  
  cp file1 file2  :- Copies one file/directory to specified location
  file filename   :- Identifie file type(binary, text, etc)
  head filename   :- Show beginning of file
  less filename   :- Browses through file from end or beginning
  tail filename   :- Show end of file
  touch filename  :- Create blank file or update modification time
  which filename  :- Show location of file if it in PATH
  whereis filename  :- Show location of file
  find filename dir :- Find file/directory  
  
  df(Disk Free)  - Manage partition space 
  df -k          - Display disk space usage in kilobytes
  du(Disk usage) - Specify directories to show disk space usage on particular directory
  -h (human readable) - Display output in format 

   

 File Operation :-
  Metacharacter  :- * (Display all matches) | ? (Matche single character)
  Creating Files :- vi filename -> i (Into edit mode start write) -> esc (Out of edit mode) -> :wq(Save & Exit)
  Editing Files  :- vi filename -> lkey to move right | h move left | k move upside | j move downside
  Display Content:- cat filename - See content of file | cat -b filename - Display line numbers with output 
  Copying Files  :- cp source_file destination_file
  Renaming Files :- mv old_file new_file
  Deleting Files :- rm filename
  Counting       :- wc filename - Count total number of lines, words, and characters contained in file



 Character indicate type of file that's listed :-
  - :- Regular file such as an ASCII text file, binary executable, or hard link
  b :- Block input/output device file such as physical hard drive
  c :- Character special file, Raw input/output device file such as a physical hard drive.
  d :- Directory file that contain listing of other files and directories
  l :- Symbolic link file, Links on any regular file
  p :- Named pipe, Mechanism for interprocess communication
  s :- Socket used for interprocess communication
  

 
 Standard Unix Stream :-
  stdin  - Standard input as file descriptor 0  | Unix read default input from STDIN
  stdout - Standard output as file descriptor 1 | Write default output at STDOUT
  stderr - Standard error as file descriptor 2  | Write all error messages at STDERR
 


 Hidden files :-
  - ls -a  list invisible files | first character dot character(.) used to store configuration information
  .profile - Bourne shell(sh) initialization script
  .kshrc   - Korn shell (ksh) initialization script
  .cshrc   - C shell (csh) initialization script
  .rhosts  - Remote shell configuration file



 User and Group Quotas :-
  - Amount of space used by single user or all users within specific group limited to value defined by administrator
  Soft Limit - If user exceed limit there is grace period that allow user to free up some space
  Hard Limit - No further files or blocks can be allocated

  quota      - Display disk usage and limit for user of group
  edquota    - Quota editor, Users or Groups quota edited
  quotacheck - Scan filesystem for disk usage, creates, checks and repairs quota files
  setquota   - Command line quota editor
  quotaon    - Disk quotas should be enabled on one or more filesystem
  quotaoff   - Disk quotas should be disabled for one or more filesystem
  repquota   - Print summary of disc usage and quotas for specified file system
  


File Permission / Access Mode :-
 ls -l :- Represent different access modes | Permission 

 Types of Permission :-
  Owner permission - Determine what action owner of file can perform on file
  Group permission - Determine what action user, who is member of group that file belongs to perform on file
  Other(world) permission - What action all other user perform on file


 Types of File Access Modes :-
  Read    - View content of file 
  Write   - Capability to modify or remove file content
  Execute - Able to run file as program


 Changing Permission :-
  chmod - Change file or directory Permissions
    +  - Add permission to file or directory
    -  - Remove permission from a file or directory
    =  - Set permission

  chmod with Absolute Permissions :- Use number to specify each set of permission for file
    0	 ---  No permission
    1	 --x  Execute permission	
    2	 -w-  Write permission
    3	 -wx  Execute and write
    4	 r--  Read 
    5	 r-x  Read and execute 
    6	 rw-  Read and write
    7	 rwx  All  

 
 Changing Owners and Group :-
  chown - "change owner" change file owner
  chgrp - "change group" change group of file
