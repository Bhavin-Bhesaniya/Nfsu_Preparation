Protection and Security :-
 - Providing protection to computer resources to Ensure that each resource accessed only by authorized user
 - If access by unauthorized user, then he/she cause severe damage to computer or data stored in it 
 - So system must protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses, worms etc.

 CIA(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) :-
  Confidentiality :- Unauthroized person not be allowed to read data to achieve it Encryption best
  Integrity       :- Unauthroized person not be allowed to modify data
  Availability    :- Data should be available for authorized users

 Principal Protection :- Give just enough privileges to perform their tasks
 Domain Structure     :- Domain is set of access-rights 
 Access Matrix        :- View protection as matrix



Authentication :- 
  - Identifying each user of the system and associating executing programs with those users 
  - It is responsibility of OS to ensures that user who is running particular program is authentic 
  - OS identifies/authenticates users using following three ways :-
    Username/Password  |  Card/Key  |  User attribute(Fingerprint/Eye retina pattern/Signature)



One Time password :-
  - Provide additional security along with normal authentication 
  - Unique password required every time to user tries to login into system 
  - Once one-time password used then it cannot be used again 
 
  Random numbers :- 
   - User provided card having numbers printed along with corresponding alphabets 
   - System asks for numbers corresponding to few alphabets randomly chosen
 
  Secret key :-
   - Provided hardware device which create secret id mapped with user id 
   - System asks for such secret id which generated every time prior to login

  Network password :- 
   - Send one-time password to user on registered mobile/ email which required to be entered prior to login

 

Threat :- 
  - Potential security violation
  - Attack is attempt to breach security
  
  Active Attack :- 
   - Masquerading(breach Authentication) | Replay Attack |  Man-in-the-middle attack | Session Hijacking
 
 
 Program Threats :-
  - OS processes and kernel do designated task as instructed 
  - If user program made these process malicious tasks then it is known as Program Threats 
  - Ex :- Program installed in computer which store and send user credentials via network to some hacker
 
  Trojan Horse :- 
   - Program traps user login credentials and stores them to send to malicious user who can later login to computer
     and access system resources
  
  Trap Door :- 
   - If program designed to work as required have security hole in its code and perform illegal action without 
     knowledge of user then it is called trap door
 
  Logic Bomb :- 
   - Situation when program misbehaves only when certain conditions met otherwise it works as genuine program 
   - Harder to detect

  Virus :- 
   - Replicate themselves on computer system 
   - Dangerous and modify/delete user files, crash system 
   - Small code embedded in program 
   - As User accesses program virus starts getting embedded in other files/ programs and make system unusable for user


 System Threat :-
   - Misuse of system services and network connections to put user in trouble 
   - Used to launch program threats on complete network called as program attack 
   - It create such environment that os resources/user files are misused 

  Worm :- 
   - Process which slow down or even shut down system performance by using system resources to extreme level 
   - Process generates its multiple copies where each copy uses system resources, prevent all other processes to
     get required resources 
 
  Port Scanning :- 
   - Mechanism by which hacker detect system vulnerabilities to make attack on system

  Denial of Service(Dos) :- 
   - Prevent user to make legitimate use of system 
   Ex :- User may not be able to use internet if denial of service attacks browser's content settings



Computer Security Classification :-
 - As per U.S. Department of Defense Trusted Computer System's Evaluation Criteria there are four security 
   classification in computer systems :- A, B, C, and D 
 - Determine and model security of systems and security solutions 
 

 Type A :- 
  - Highest Level Uses formal design specifications and verification techniques 
  - Grants high degree of assurance of process security


 Type B :-
  - Provide mandatory protection system 
  - Have all properties of class C2 system 
  - Attach sensitivity label to each object 
  Types :-
   B1 - Maintain security label of each object in system used for making decision to access control
   B2 - Extend sensitivity labels to each system resource such as storage object, support covert channels and
        auditing of events
   B3 - Allow creating list or user groups for access-control to grant access or revoke access to given named object
  	

 Type C :-
  - Provide protection and user accountability using audit capabilities 
  Types :-
   C1 - In-corporate control so that user protect their private information and keep other users from accidentally 
        reading / deleting their data. UNIX version mostly Cl class
   C2 - Add individual-level access control to capabilities of Cl level system


 Type D :-
  - Lowest level  |  Minimum protection  |  MS-DOS, Window 3.1 fall in this category
