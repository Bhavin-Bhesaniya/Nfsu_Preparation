Memory Management & Degree of MultiProgramming :-
 - Method of managing and Efficient utilization of primary memory
 - More No of process(Degree of multi-programming) in ram CPU utilization is high
 - Memory is large arrays of byte where every byte has some address
 - Some part of memory occupied by OS when system start
 
 Function :- 
  Memoey Allocation(Ready -> Running), Deallocation(Running -> Terminate) and 
  Protection(P1,P2 -> P1cpu -> Access only allocate resources)
 
 Goal :- 
  Maximum Utilization(Minimum Fragmentation) 
  Run Larger Program with limited space(Using Virtual memory)

 Formula :-
  k - I/O Operation time
  Cpu Time = (1-k^n)  # n means no of process

 MMT Types :-
  Contiguous     :- Enitre process store in consecutive location | Fixed Partition, Variable Partition
  Non-contiguous :- Process store in non-consecutive location    | Paging, Segmentation
 



Contiguous Memory Management Techniques :-
 - Provide Contiguous Memory Block for process in RAM
 - Enitre process store in consecutive location 

 Fixed Partition | Static Partition :-
  - No. of Partition is fixed in memory and evey partition accommodate only one process 
  - Partition size will be same or may not same
  - Process put in any partition of memory but only in same partition
  - Spanning is not allow means put entire process in same partition not allow to put in different partition
  
  - Used in main Frame computer during 1960 
  - Process size bigger than partition size in memory it generate problem of size limit partition
  - Fixed no of partition so Not add more processes in RAM above partition size
  - Combination of all available memory in different slots equal to process size or less size
    but not allowed due to contiguous called External Fragmentation
  - So Whenever internal Fragmentation arise their must be an external Fragmentation  
  
  Ex :- If P1 = 2MB and M1 = 4MB remaining M1 2MB size was wasted which was called Internal Fragmentation 


  
 Variable Partition | Dynamic Partition :-   
  - Allocating space for process based on their space requirements(Partition size Same as process size)
  - Main memory not divided into partition initially 

  Advantages :-  
   - No chance for internal Fragmentation
   - No limitation on Degree of programming(No Of Process) and process size 

  Disadvantages :-
   - Process complete its execution in RAM it create one hole (4MB)
   - Two process complete its execution now one process come with bigger size than available RAM in space
     4MB + 4MB BUT Process size 8MB so external fragmentation
   - To remove fragmentation use Compaction means collect all allocated process one side and remaining space other side
     means stop process or move process from one address to another which take more time
   - Allocation and deallocation little bit complex  
   


 Process Allocation Policy(How to allocate process in Hole):-
  First-Fit :- 
   - Allocate first partition that big enough for that process            
   - P1=15KB => S1=25KB | S2=35KB store in S1
   - Search from beginning so searching time low and fast 
   - Remaining portion of memory create big holes in memory so internal Fragmentation


  Next-Fit  :- 
   - Same as first fit but start search always from last allocated hole 
   - p2=15KB => S2=28KB | S3=30KB store in S2 Not S1
   - Not need to search from beginning because First-Fit already searched


  Best-Fit  :- 
   - Search entire list and allocate smallest partition that big enough for process so minimal internal fragmentation
   - If add process in hole remaining portion will be least 
   - Problem Create tiny holes which not helpful for other and search entire ram so very Slow
   - p2=15KB => S5=22KB | S8=20KB  Store in S8 Not S2 
                
  
  Worst-Fit :- 
   - Allocate largest hole
   - p2=15KB => S5=22KB | S8=20KB  Store in S5 Not S8
   - Problem Create big holes where other process join but search entire ram so very Slow

   
  Example :- 
   Request from process are 300kb, 25k, 125k, 50k so which will be best for it :-
   R1 = 150KB  | R2 = 350KB  # Hole
    First Fit :- P1 --> R2(50) | P2 --> R1(125)  | P3 --> R1(0)  | P4 -->R2(0)
    Best Fit  :- P1 --> R2(50) | P2 --> R2(25)   | P3 --> R1(25) | P4 Not fit with space because R1(25), R2(25)
    Worst Fit :- P1 --> R2(50) | P2 --> R1(125)  | P3 --> R1(0)  | P4 -->R2(0)


  Example With TimeLine :- BestFit

   Partition Size :- R1(4K) | R2(8K) | R3(20K) | R4(2K)

   Solve :- 
    - J1 --> R1(0)() | J2 --> R3(6K) | J3 --> R1(1K) | J4 --> R2(2K)
    - Slot full waiting for release other process 
      J4C --> R2(8K) | J5 --> R2(2K) | J2C --> R3(20K) | J6 --> R3(10K)
    - At time 11 J6 Remove and At 12 J5 Remove but we need to consider 11 time
      J6C --> R3(20K) | J7 --> R3(13K)  
       



Non-Contiguous Memory Management Techniques :-
 - Process divided and place in different location for removing external fragmentation
 - Problem arise that holes are created dynamically so whenever process come in ram Check holes and its size 
   than according size divided process to fit in that location so very time consuming
 - To solve these divide process before enter in ram that called pages
 - Size of Page = Size of Frame(Main memory Partition)


 Paging :-
  - Process Divided in equal size of pages and insert into same size Frames(Physical memory Partition)
  - Frame and page numbers are represent in binary so its always start with 0
  - Every process has its own page table that containing frame number where process page is allocated in memory
  - Page table also store in main memory in form of pages
  - Number of entries in page tables = Number of page in process 
  - Each entry in page tables contains = Frame No. + Extra-bits

  Diagram :-
   Process        Page Table       Physical Memory
               PageNo. Frame No   Frame No
    Pg-1          2       2         0       Pg-N   
    Pg-2          1       1         1       Pg-1                
    Pg-N          N       0         2       Pg-2
                                      

  Mapping :- 
   - Process of Convert Cpu generated logical address into absolute address done by MMU(Memory Management Unit)
   - CPU works on logical address space(LAS) which created by two factor :- Page  number and page  offset(sizeof page)
   - Physical address space (PAS) represent location of bytes in memory  :- Frame number and Frame offset(sizeof frame)

  Formula :- 
    Page Table Size = No. of entries in P.T.  * 1 Entry Size
                    = No. of pages in process * 1 Entry Size(Frame no + Extra bits) 
   
   
  Page Table Entry :-
   - Page table Use MMU to convert logical address into physical address for mapping
   First Field  -> Frame No (Mandatory)
   Second Field -> Valid-1/Invalid-0 | Tells whether page is present or not at that location(Page Fault) 
   Protection(RWX)(Read Write Execute) -> Check Permission on particular file or page  
   Reference(0/1)  -> When swapping page it need to tell either bring that page in past using LRU(least recently used)
   Caching         -> Enable or disable caching 
   Dirty/Modified  -> User change any page data or update data to update data in secondary memory



  Multi-level | 2-Level Paging :-
   - Page table size bigger than main memory frame size divided it into smaller page(Outer page) and stored
     page into outer page



  Inverted Paging :-
   - Instead of keeping all page table of all process there will be only one page table(Global Page Table)
   - Global page table contain --> Frame No | Page No | Process ID 
   - No. of frame in frame table is same no. of page entries
   - Problem is searching time because it use Linear Search 



 Segmentation :-
  - Divide process into segment(Releated Part) then put into memory
  - Each segment has different logical address space of program
  - When process executed corresponding segmentation loaded into non-contiguous memory though every segment loaded 
    into contiguous block of available memory
  - Segment contain program main, utility function, data structure etc..
  - Paging divided process without known user which occurs in different problems(Function Problem C Program)
  - In paging all page size same while in segment size are not same
  - OS maintain Segment map table which used to convert logical address into physical address
  - Segment table contain --> Segment No  :  Segment Size  :  Base address(From where its start)
  Trap :- If cpu demand is higher than actual segment size 

  Diagram :-

                Segment Number   Size   Memory Address     OS 
    Segment-1         1           400    100              
    Segment-N         N            x     NM                100 
                                                           NM

  


Thrashing :-
 - Directly linked with Degree of Multi-Programming
 - Cpu ask for page but its not available called Page Fault and it check by Page Fault Service Time 
 - When page fault service takes lots of time and entire OS busy in servicing page Fault
 - Page Hit Decreases and page Fault become heavy Due to that CPU utilization decreases suddenly known as Thrashing
 - To remove it either increases main memory size or decreases long-term scheduler speed




Overlay :-
 - If process size is more than size of memory then that process accommodate in main memory which known as overlay
 - Os has not any drivers for overlay so user need to decied how to bring partition in program to use functionality
 - Partition should be independent
 - Use in embedded system




Virtual Memory :-
 - Provide illusion where we able to execute process if its size is larger than physical memory called virtual memory 
 - Divided process --> Allow only Required Process Page in main memory
 - It is section of hard disk that's set up to emulate computer's RAM
 - Advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory 
 - MMU translate virtual addresses into physical addresses
 
 Purpose :- 
  - Extend use of physical memory by using disk 
  - Memory protection because each virtual address translated to physical addresses

 - Virtual memory implemented by demand paging or demand segmentation system
 

 Demand Paging :-
  - Similar to paging with swapping processes reside in secondary memory and page loaded only on demand not in advance 
  - During context switch OS does not copy any old program’s pages out to the disk or any of the new program’s pages
    into main memory Instead, it begin executing new program after loading first page and fetches that program’s page
    as they referenced
  - While executing program if program references page which not available in main memory because it was swapped out
    ,Processor treat as invalid memory reference as page fault and transfer control from program to OS for demand 
    page back into memory
  - Large virtual memory | Efficient memory usage | No limit on degree of multiprogramming
  - Number of tables and amount of processor overhead for handling page interrupts are greater than in the case of 
    simple page management techniques

 

Page Replacement Algorithm :- 
 - Used by OS to decides which memory pages to swap out, write to disk when page of memory needs to be allocated
 - Paging happens whenever page fault occurs and free page not be used for allocation
 - Lesser waiting time for page-insert the better is the algorithm
 - PRA look limited information about accessing pages provided by hardware and tries to select pages that should
   be replaced to minimize total number of page misses and balancing it with primary storage cost and processor time
   of algorithm itself
 - Evaluate algorithm by running it on particular string of memory reference and computing number of page fault

 Reference String :-
  - String of memory references is called reference string
  - Generated artificially or by tracing given system and recording address of each memory reference
  - Latter choice produces large number of data
  - For given page size consider only page number not entire address
  
 First-in-first-out(FIFO) :-
