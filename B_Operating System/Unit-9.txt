Unix :-
 
 
Linux 
 - Open source free to use 
 - Version of UNIX operating System 
 - Designed, compatibility and functionality quite similar to UNIX



Component of Linux :-
 Kernel :-
  - Core part of Linux 
  - Responsible for all major activities of OS 
  - Consists of various modules and interacts directly with underlying hardware 
  - Provide required abstraction to hide low level hardware details to system or application program

 System Library :- 
  - Special function or program using which application program or system utilities accesses Kernel's features 
  - Implement most of functionalities of OS and not requires kernel module's code access right

 System Utility :-
  - Responsible to do specialized, individual level tasks



Architecture :-
 Linux OS 
  System    User     User    Compilers
  Software  Process  Utility
          System Library
            Kernel
          Kernel Module

 Hardware layer - Consists of all peripheral devices (RAM/HDD/CPU etc..)
 Kernel    - Core component of OS which interacts directly with hardware provides low level services to upper layer
 Shell     - Interface to kernel hiding complexity of kernel's functions from users
 Utilities/Application - Program that provide most of user functionalities of os



Kernel Mode vs User Mode :-
 - Kernel code executes special privileged mode called kernel mode with full access to all resources of computer 
 - User mode code which not required to run in kernel mode is in System Library 
 - User program which has no access to system hardware and kernel code 
 


Feature :-
 Portable    :- Works on different types of hardware in same way 
 Open Source :- Freely available and it is community based development project 
 Multi-User  :- Multiple users access system resources like memory/ram/application programs at same time
 Shell       :- Provide interpreter program used to execute command of OS 
 Security    :- Authentication password protection  |  Controlled access to specific files  |  Encryption of data
 Multiprogramming :- Multiple applications run at same time
 Hierarchical File System :- Provide standard file structure in which system files/user files are arranged
