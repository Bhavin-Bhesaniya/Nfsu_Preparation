What is Vulnerability in Cyber Security?
 - Vulnerability refer to weakness in system, system processes or internal control of organization 
 - Hackers gain illegal access to system and cause severe damage to data privacy 
 - It is Extremely important to monitor for overall security posture as gaps in network result in full-scale breach
   of system in organization

 Examples :-  
  - Weakness in firewall lead to malicious hacker getting into computer network
  - Lack of security cameras
  - Unlocked doors at businesses



How vulnerability different from threat and risk?
 - Vulnerabilities not introduced to system rather they are there from beginning 
 - It typically result of OS flaws or network misconfiguration 
 - Threat introduced to system like virus download or social engineering attack
 - Risk actually probability and impact of vulnerability being exploited 
 - If these two factors low then risk low 
 
 - Impact of cyberattacks tied to CIA triad of resource 
 - Common vulnerabilities pose no risk when vulnerability has not much value to organization



When does vulnerability become exploitable?
 - vulnerability has at least one definite attack vector is exploitable 
 - Attackers will, for obvious reasons, want to target weaknesses in system or network that are exploitable
 - Of course, it is not something that anyone want to have but what more worried about it being exploitable
 There are cases when something that vulnerable not really exploitable :-
  - Insufficient public information for exploitation by attackers
  - Prior authentication or local system access that attacker may not have
  - Existing security controls

 
 
What causes vulnerability?
 OS Flaws - Unsecured OS by default give users full access and become target for viruses and malware
 Internet - Full of spyware and adware that installed automatically on computer
 Unchecked user input(SQL injection) | Software Bug      | People(Social engineering)
 Familiarity with common code        | Connected devices | Poor Password Management | Complex System(Misconfiguration)
 


Types of Vulnerabilities :-
 System Misconfigurations 
 Out-of-date or Unpatched Software
 Missing or Weak Authorization Credentials
 Malicious Insider Threats (Network access control and network according to employee seniority and expertise)
 Missing or Poor Data Encryption
 Zero-day Vulnerabilities



What is Vulnerability Management?
 - Cyclical practice consisting of identification, classification, remediation and mitigation of vulnerabilities
 
 Vulnerability Detection :-
  - Vulnerability scanning | Penetration testing | Google hacking

 Vulnerability scanning :-
  - Find vulnerabilities in computer, application or network
  - Scanner(software) used which discover and identify vulnerabilities that arise from misconfiguration and flawed
    programming within network
  - SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager(NCM), ManageEngine Vulnerability Manager Plus, Rapid7 Nexpose, Acunetix,
    Probely, TripWire IP 360, etc.

 Penetration Testing / Pen testing :-
  - Practice of testing IT asset for security vulnerabilities that attacker could potentially exploit
  - It may be automated or manual 
  - Test security policies, employee security awareness, ability to identify and respond to security incident and 
    compliance requirement
  
 Google Hacking :-
  - Use search engine to locate security vulnerabilities through advanced search operator in queries that locate 
    hard-to-find information or data that accidentally exposed due to misconfiguration of cloud service 
  - Mostly these targeted queries used to locate sensitive information that not intended for public exposure



Cyber Security Vulnerability Assessment :-
 - Once vulnerability detected goes assessment process
 - Vulnerability management becomes continuous and repetitive practice because cyber attacks constantly evolving
 
 What is a vulnerability assessment? 
  - Process of systematically reviewing security weaknesses in information system 
  - It highlight whenever system prone to any known vulnerabilities as well as classifies severity levels and 
    recommend appropriate remediation or mitigation if required
  
 Assessment process include :-
  Identify vulnerabilities :- Analyzing network scan, firewall log, pentest result to find highlight vulnerabilities   
  Verify vulnerabilities   :- Whether identified vulnerability exploited or not classify its level of risk
  Mitigate vulnerabilities :- Take appropriate countermeasure and measure their effectiveness if patch not available
  Remediate vulnerabilities:- Update affected software or hardware wherever possible

 Types of vulnerability assessment :-
  Network-based assessment :- 
   - Identify issues in network security 
   - Detect systems that are vulnerable on both wired and wireless network

  Host-based assessment :- 
   - Help to locate and identify vulnerabilities in server, workstation and other network host 
   - Assesses open port and services make configuration setting and patch management of scanned system more visible
  
  Wireless network assessment :- 
   - Scanning of Wi-Fi network and attack vectors in infrastructure of wireless network 
   - Validate that network securely configured to avoid unauthorized access also detect rogue access point

  Application assessment :- 
   - Identification of security vulnerabilities in web application and their source code 
   - Achieved by implementing automated vulnerability scanning tools on front-end or analyzing source code statically
     or dynamically
  
  Database assessment :- 
   - Assessment of databases or big data system for vulnerabilities and misconfiguration, identifying rogue database
     or insecure dev/test environment and classifying sensitive data to improve data security



Vulnerability Remediation :-
 - If tracking result show that services and product relying on risky code vulnerable component needs to be located 
   and mitigated effectively and efficiently
 Step 1 : Know Your Code
 Step 2 : Prioritize Your Vulnerabilities 
 Step 3 : Fix â€“ Once security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention known time to map out timeline and work
          plan for fix


Conclusion :-
 - With network becoming more and more complex, it become critical to actively manage cyber security vulnerabilitie
 - To actively manage cyber security vulnerabilities it essential to have visibility of internal and third-party 
   network ecosystem
