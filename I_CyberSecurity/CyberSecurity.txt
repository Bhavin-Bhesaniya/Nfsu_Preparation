   - Accomplished by overwhelming target with more traffic than it handle

  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) :-
   - Disrupt computer network by overwhelming server and request 
   - Network gets flooded with superfluous request from hundred or thousand of IP addresses that overload system and 
     keep legitimate request from being fulfilled 
   - It causes target system like website to crash from overload of demand
 
 Passive Attack :-
  - Scarce from classification perspective but carried out with relative ease, particularly if traffic not encrypted
 
  Eavesdropping(tapping) :- 
   - Attacker listen to messages exchanged by two entities

Vulnerability :-
 - Gaps or weaknesses in system that make threat possible and tempt threat actor to exploit them
 - When threat probability multiplied by potential loss that may result, cyber security experts refer to this as risk
 Types :- SQL injection | Server Misconfiguration | Cross-site Scripting | Transmitting sensitive data in non-
          encrypted plain text format
 Categories :-
  Corrupted (Loss of integrity) | Leaky (Loss of confidentiality) | Unavailable or very slow (Loss of availability) 
 
 What is Vulnerability in Cyber Security?
 - Vulnerability refer to weakness in system, system processes or internal control of organization 
 - Hackers gain illegal access to system and cause severe damage to data privacy 
 - It is Extremely important to monitor for overall security posture as gaps in network result in full-scale breach
   of system in organization

 Examples :-  
  - Weakness in firewall lead to malicious hacker getting into computer network
  - Lack of security cameras
  - Unlocked doors at businesses


 When does vulnerability become exploitable?
 - vulnerability has at least one definite attack vector is exploitable 
 - Attackers will, for obvious reasons, want to target weaknesses in system or network that are exploitable
 - Of course, it is not something that anyone want to have but what more worried about it being exploitable
 There are cases when something that vulnerable not really exploitable :-
  - Insufficient public information for exploitation by attackers
  - Prior authentication or local system access that attacker may not have
  - Existing security controls

 
 
 What causes vulnerability?
 OS Flaws - Unsecured OS by default give users full access and become target for viruses and malware
 Internet - Full of spyware and adware that installed automatically on computer
 Unchecked user input(SQL injection) | Software Bug      | People(Social engineering)
 Familiarity with common code        | Connected devices | Poor Password Management | Complex System(Misconfiguration)
 


 Types of Vulnerabilities :-

 Zero-day Vulnerabilities



 What is Vulnerability Management?
 - Cyclical practice consisting of identification, classification, remediation and mitigation of vulnerabilities
 
 Vulnerability Detection :-
  - Vulnerability scanning | Penetration testing | Google hacking

 Vulnerability scanning :-
  - Find vulnerabilities in computer, application or network
  - Scanner(software) used which discover and identify vulnerabilities that arise from misconfiguration and flawed
    programming within network
  - SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager(NCM), ManageEngine Vulnerability Manager Plus, Rapid7 Nexpose, Acunetix,
    Probely, TripWire IP 360, etc.

 Penetration Testing / Pen testing :-
  - Practice of testing IT asset for security vulnerabilities that attacker could potentially exploit
  - It may be automated or manual 
  - Test security policies, employee security awareness, ability to identify and respond to security incident and 
    compliance requirement
  
 Google Hacking :-
  - Use search engine to locate security vulnerabilities through advanced search operator in queries that locate 
    hard-to-find information or data that accidentally exposed due to misconfiguration of cloud service 
  - Mostly these targeted queries used to locate sensitive information that not intended for public exposure


 Cyber Security Vulnerability Assessment :-
 - Once vulnerability detected goes assessment process
 - Vulnerability management becomes continuous and repetitive practice because cyber attacks constantly evolving
 
 What is a vulnerability assessment? 
  - Process of systematically reviewing security weaknesses in information system 
  - It highlight whenever system prone to any known vulnerabilities as well as classifies severity levels and 
    recommend appropriate remediation or mitigation if required
  
 Assessment process include :-
  Identify vulnerabilities :- Analyzing network scan, firewall log, pentest result to find highlight vulnerabilities   
  Verify vulnerabilities   :- Whether identified vulnerability exploited or not classify its level of risk
  Mitigate vulnerabilities :- Take appropriate countermeasure and measure their effectiveness if patch not available
  Remediate vulnerabilities:- Update affected software or hardware wherever possible

 Types of vulnerability assessment :-
  Network-based assessment :- 
   - Identify issues in network security 
   - Detect systems that are vulnerable on both wired and wireless network

  Host-based assessment :- 
   - Help to locate and identify vulnerabilities in server, workstation and other network host 
   - Assesses open port and services make configuration setting and patch management of scanned system more visible
  
  Wireless network assessment :- 
   - Scanning of Wi-Fi network and attack vectors in infrastructure of wireless network 
   - Validate that network securely configured to avoid unauthorized access also detect rogue access point

  Application assessment :- 
   - Identification of security vulnerabilities in web application and their source code 
   - Achieved by implementing automated vulnerability scanning tools on front-end or analyzing source code statically
     or dynamically
  
  Database assessment :- 
   - Assessment of databases or big data system for vulnerabilities and misconfiguration, identifying rogue database
     or insecure dev/test environment and classifying sensitive data to improve data security

 Vulnerability Remediation :-
  - If tracking result show that services and product relying on risky code vulnerable component needs to be located 
    and mitigated effectively and efficiently
  Step 1 : Know Your Code
  Step 2 : Prioritize Your Vulnerabilities 
  Step 3 : Fix – Once security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention known time to map out timeline and work
          plan for fix

 Conclusion :-
  - With network becoming more and more complex, it become critical to actively manage cyber security vulnerabilitie
  - To actively manage cyber security vulnerabilities it essential to have visibility of internal and third-party 
    network ecosystem  



How vulnerability different from threat and risk?
 - Vulnerabilities not introduced to system rather they are there from beginning 
 - It typically result of OS flaws or network misconfiguration 
 - Threat introduced to system like virus download or social engineering attack
 - Risk actually probability and impact of vulnerability being exploited 
 - If these two factors low then risk low 
 
 - Impact of cyberattacks tied to CIA triad of resource 
 - Common vulnerabilities pose no risk when vulnerability has not much value to organization



Cyber criminals :-
 - Access to enormous amounts of hardware, software, and data
 - They have potential to cripple much of effective business and government throughout world

   - Hackers | Nation-states | Criminal Groups | Terrorist Groups | Malicious Insiders
   Emerging Cyber Threats :- Pandemic-related attacks | Cloud Breaches | IoT Attacks 



Security Policies :- 
 - Set of rules which issued by organization to ensure that user who authorized to access company technology and 
   information assets comply with rules and guidelines related to security of information
 - "living document" means document never finished but it continuously updated as requirement of technology 
 - It manage network security 
 - Most policies are automatically created during installation  
 Need :- Efficiency  |  Discipline and accountability  |  Educate employees on security literacy

  - Blocks unauthorized users from accessing system and network that connect to Internet
  - Detect attacks by cybercriminals and removes unwanted sources of network traffic

 Intrusion Prevention policy :- 
  - Automatically detect and blocks network attacks and browser attack
  - Also protect application from vulnerabilities and check contents of one or more data packages and detects malware
    which coming through legal ways
 
 Application and Device Control :- 
  - Protect system's resources from application and manage peripheral devices that attach to system
  - Device control policy applies to both Windows and Mac computers whereas application control policy applied only
    to Windows client
 


OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project) top-10 :-
 - OWASP nonprofit security organization that conducts security assessment and gives insights into critical security
   flaws in software
 - OWASP primarily focuses on the back end rather than design issues
 - OWASP ZAP(Zed Attack Proxy) integrated vulnerability scanning tool for detecting flaws in web-based application
 - Constantly updated document that outlines web application security concern, focusing on 10 most significant issue 
 - Raise awareness about application security by identifying some most critical risks facing organization
 - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities reflect widespread agreement on most severe web security deficiencies

 Injection :-
  - Injection flaws happen when untrusted data sent to interpreter as part of command or query 
  - Injection attack meddle fundamental security concept of access control 
  - injection is not specific to a technology or programming language
  - Malicious user tinker with search feature in hope of injecting input called payload to perform unintended result
    by vulnerable system 
  - If successful malicious user trick application to revert sensitive information

  Injection Vulnerabilities :- 
   - SQL injection | OS command injection | Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) injection
   
  Preventing Injection Attacks :- 
   - Secure interface | Utilize server-side user authentication
   - Special characters should be approached with caution



 Broken Authentication :- 
   - Authentication process where user grant genuinity of who they are 
   - Attacker mimic someone and gain access to their data or functionality 
   - Authentication and session involve cookies that provide easy way for attacker to try and portray someone else
   - Application functionalities linked to authentication and session management frequently implemented improperly 
     allowing intruders to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens or exploit other implementation defects to
     temporarily or permanently assume other users’ identities
   
   Broken Authentication :- Compromised credentials such as username and password
   
   Broken Authentication Vulnerabilities :-
    - Insecure login form | Logout management | Administration portal | Session ID in URL
   
   Preventing broken authentication attack :-
    - Use modern framework | HTTP only and secure flags on cookies | password hashing algorithm
    - Use combination of independent pen testing and code review
    
    

 Sensitive Data Exposure :-
   - Attackers steal or modify such clumsily-defended data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft or other crime
   - Sensitive data negotiated without extra protection such as encryption at rest or in transit and require special 
     precaution when exchanged with browser

   Sensitive Data Exposure Vulnerabilities :- Credential stuffing | Password-based attack
   
   Preventing Sensitive Data Exposure :-
    - PCI, GDPR and many more security 
    - Reduce scope of blast radius
    - Ensure best security practices


  
 XML External Entities : -
   - XML ability to define new entities such as turn and foo 
   - Simple text replacement that in-lined in XML declaration but they refer to external file
   - XXE attacks take advantage of ability to read arbitrary files and URIs to allow wide range of attack scenarios
   
   Preventing XXE Attacks :-
    - Reducing[13][14] XXE attack generally straightforward and require passing additional flags to XML parser 
    - Generally speaking, these[15][16] attacks flags for disallowing inline DTDs and removing entities entirely
    


 Broken Access Control  :-
   - Whenever hacker exploit access to system known as breach access control 
   - Attacker access computer either as user or administrator
   - Restriction on what authenticated user allowed to do are often not enforced 
   - Attacker exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality of data such as access other user account 
     view sensitive files, modify another user data, change access rights etc..
   
   Preventing Broken Access Control Attacks :- 
    - Implement access control
    - Manage multiple access profiles and follow least privileged policy
    - Use of logging and monitoring
    - Continuous testing application
    
  

 Security Misconfiguration :-
   - It caused by insecure default setup, ad hoc configuration, open cloud storage, incorrect HTTP header and verbose 
     error messages revealing sensitive information
   - All OS, frameworks, libraries and application not only be securely set up but also patched or upgraded promptly
   
   Ex :- Open S3 bucket | Unencrypted database | Default admin credential | Unnecessary ports or services
         Verbose error messages or server version information
   
   Preventing Security Misconfiguration Attacks:
    Hardened system : Use automated process such as cloud formation
    Patch and update software : Prioritize patches and implement their impact
 
 
  
 Cross-site Scripting (XSS) :-
   - XSS code injection attack executed on client-side of web application
   - Attacker inject malicious script through web browser 
   - Malicious script executed when victim visits web page or web server
   - Cross-site scripting utilized to steal sensitive information such as cookies, session token and other private data

   Preventing :- Escape user input | Consider all input as threat | Data validation | Sanitize data
 
  
  
 Insecure Deserialization :-
   - Happen in remote code execution 
   - Not allow for remote code execution they leveraged to launch attack such as replay attack, injection attack and 
     privilege escalation attack
   - Occur when program fails to sufficiently secure this procedure 
   - If default parameter utilized application have little control over what data deserialized 
   - Any incoming serialized visual data may be included with no authentication or safeguard

   Preventing :- 
    - Prevent data from tampering while the objects are getting serialized
    - Log to detect insecure deserialization | Code isolation



 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities :-
   - Online service that contain component known as security flaws 
   - Known vulnerability component might be component itself, CMS utilized, webserver, plugin loaded or even library
     used by one of these libraries
   - Libraries, frameworks, and other software modules nearly always executed with full right 
   - Attack that takes advantage of weak component might result in significant data loss or server takeover 
   - Application that use component with known vulnerabilities may bypass application protection and enable variety 
     of potential attack and consequences

   Preventing :-
    - In event that patches cannot be addressed, maintain continuous inventory and monitor OWASP dependency check
    - Deserialization issues detected by using application security tool 
    - Penetration testing confirm that issues exist
 


 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring :-
   - Affect underlying infrastructure not only computer HTTP server 
   - Large number of logs—practically all new device produce unique record so log handling becomes huge issue 
   - Information gathering become too much to successfully monitor and manage
   - So all individual log collected together and aggregated

   Preventing :-
    - Programmer examine testing record to detect potential flaws and vulnerabilities 
    - SAST systems aid in detection of unlogged safety issue
