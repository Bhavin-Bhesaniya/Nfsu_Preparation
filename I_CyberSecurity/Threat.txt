What are Cyber Threats?
 - Threat is malicious act performed by hacker to intentionally steal data or other assets, misuse them or simply 
   cause disruption in digital life in general 
 - Threat come from remote location by unknown parties or even within organization by trusted users 
 
 Types :- Disruption espionage | Corporate espionage (theft of patents) | State espionage
  
 Malware :-
  - Software that perform malicious action on device or network such as data corruption or taking over system 
  - Malware makes its way into system through malicious link or email that user click 
  - It block access to critical component of network gather sensitive data and damage system

 Spyware :-
  - Form of malware that stays concealed on device and transmit real-time data like bank details and passwords 
    to its host

 Phishing :-
  - Hacker attempt to bait individuals into disclosing critical information such as personally identifiable information
    (PII), banking details and password known as phishing 
  Ex :- Email 
  
 Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) :-
  - Disrupt computer network by overwhelming server and request 
  - Network gets flooded with superfluous request from hundred or thousand of IP addresses that overload system and 
    keep legitimate request from being fulfilled 
  - It causes target system like website to crash from overload of demand

 Ransomware :-
  - Malware that blocks access to system or data until ransom paid 
  - Attack involves data encryption on target system that render all files inaccessible and demand monetary ransom
    to give back access to owner again 
  
 Zero-day exploits :-
  - Happen same day flaw occurs in software, hardware, or firmware
  - Because software flaw is recent, it is hard to put up protection system in place immediately

 Advanced persistent threats(APTs) :-
  - Unauthorized user gaining access to system and remaining there without being detected for long period of time

 Trojan Horse :-
  - Malware or code initially act as legitimate standard application or file and trick one into loading and executing 
    malware on their device 
  - Once inside host system trojan lets out malicious code that has potential to damage, steal data or inflict some
    other harmful activity on network

 Wiper attack :-
  - Wipe out hard drive of computer it infects 
  - It involves wiping, overwriting, or removing data from victim 
  - Mainly destructive in nature and often do not involve ransom 
  - Used to cover tracks of separate data theft that occurring 

 Intellectual property theft :-
  - Stealing or using someone elseâ€™s intellectual property without permission

 Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM attack) :-
  - Attacker insert himself in middle of communication between two parties like user and application and attempt to 
    steal information 
  - Attackers eavesdrop or impersonate one of parties, making it appear as if normal exchange of information underway

 Drive-by downloads :-
  - Installing malicious program like spyware, malware, or virus
  - Download that happen without knowledge of person like computer virus, spyware, malware, or crimeware

 Malvertising / Malware advertising :-
  - Online advertisement that spread malware and compromise system through injection of malicious code into ads

 Rogue Security Software :-
  - Internet fraud that disguised as real software and tricks user into believing that their computer has virus 
  - Convince users to pay for fake malware removal tool that instead install malware on their computer


 
Sources of Cyber Threats :-
 - To effectively protect against cyberattacks essential to understand threat actors and their intentions 
 - Hackers | Nation-states | Criminal Groups | Terrorist Groups | Malicious Insiders
 Emerging Cyber Threats :- Pandemic-related attacks | Cloud Breaches | IoT Attacks



Protection :-
 Firewall | Internet security suite   | Endpoint protection             | Identity theft protection |
 Training | Securing sites with HTTPS | Two-factor authentication (2FA) | Installing antivirus program |
 Cyber Incident Response Plan (CSIRP) | Creating backups 



Cyber Defense for Businesses :-
 - Many attacks become unsuccessful when IT department deploy security patches on timely basis
 - Continual attack simulation tools          | Outsourced security services 
 - Collaboration between security team member | Anti-phishing and secure browsing point solutions



Cyber Defense for Individuals :-
 Password hygiene | Anti-virus software | Preventing phishing attacks(Careful when opening any file attachment)
