What is CyberSecuirty? 
 - Technique and practices designed to protect digital data
 - Cyber related to technology which contain system, network and programs or data
 - Security related to protection include system security, network security, application and information security



CIA(Confidentiality Integrity Availability) Triad :-
 - Security model that developed to help people think about various parts of IT security


 Confidentiality :-
  - Preventing private data from unauthorized parties
  - Keep identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and holding data private and anonymous
  - It Compromised by cracking poorly encrypted data, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, disclosing sensitive data
  - Amount of damage suffered if confidentiality was breached  

  Measures to establish confidentiality :-
   - Data encryption 
   - Two-factor authentication 
   - Biometric verification 
   - Security tokens 
   - Access control
 
 
 Integrity  :-
  - Protecting information from being modified by unauthorized parties(Deletion or modification)
  
  Measures for integrity :- 
   - Cryptographic checksums 
   - Using file permissions 
   - Uninterrupted power supplies 
   - Data backups 
 
 
 Availability :-
  - Make sure that Authorized parties able to access information when needed
  
  Measures to availability :-
   - Backing up data to external drives 
   - Implementing firewall
   - Having backup power supplies 
   - Data redundancy



Types of Cyber attacks :-
 - Exploitation of computer system and network 
 - Use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data to lead cybercrimes such as information and identity theft

 Types of attacks :- Web-based | System-based | Active | Passive

 Web-based attacks :-
  - Attack which occur on a website or web applications
  
  Injection attacks :-
   - Some data will be injected into web application to manipulate application and fetch required information
   Ex :- SQL Injection, code Injection, log Injection, XML Injection etc. 
  

  DNS Spoofing :-
  - Malicious Data pased into DNS resolver's cache causing name server to return incorrect IP address that diverting 
    traffic to attackers computer or any other computer
  - It can go for long period of time without being detected and cause serious security issues


  Session Hijacking :-
   - Attack on user session over protected network
   - Web application create cookies to store state and user session 
   - By stealing cookies, attacker have access to all of user data


  Phishing :-
   - Attempt to steal sensitive information like user login credentials and credit card number 
   - It occurs when attacker masquerading as trustworthy entity in electronic communication
  

  Brute force :-
   - Use trial and error method 
   - Attack generates large number of guesses and validate them to obtain actual data like user password and personal 
     identification number  
   - Used by criminals to crack encrypted data or by security analyst to test organization's network security


  Denial of Service  :-
   - It Make server or network resource unavailable to user 
   - It accomplishes by flooding target with traffic or sending it information that triggers crash 
   - Single system and single internet connection used to attack on server 
   
   It classified into following :-
    Volume-based     :- Saturate bandwidth of attacked site measured in bit per second
    Protocol attacks :- Consume actual server resources measured in packet
    Application layer attacks :- Crash web server measured in request per second
  
  
  Dictionary attack :-
   - Use stored list of commonly used password and validated them to get original password
  
  
  URL Interpretation :-
   - Change certain parts of URL and one make server to deliver web pages for which he is not authorized to browse
  
  
  File Inclusion attack :-
   - Allow attacker to access unauthorized or essential files which available on web server or to execute malicious
     files on web server by making use of include functionality 

  Man in the middle attacks :-
   - Allow attacker to intercept connection Between Client and server and acts as bridge between them 
   - Now Attcker able to read, insert and modify data in intercepted connection
 
 
 System-based attack :-
  - Intended to compromise computer or Computer network
  
  Virus :-
   - Self-replicating malicious computer program that replicates itself into computer program when executed 
   - It attach itself to host file or hard drive sector
   - Replicates each time host used for destruction or corruption of data
   - Attach files with execution capabilities such as .doc, .exe, and .bat extensions
   - Often distributes via e-mail
   Ex :- Stoned, Michelangelo, Melissa, I Love You
 
  
  Worm  :-
   - Types of malware whose primary function to replicate itself to spread to uninfected computers 
   - Worms often originate from email attachments that appear to be from trusted sender
   - It Can install backdoor in infected computer
   - Is usually introduced into system through vulnerability
   - Infect one system and spread to other systems on network
   Ex :- Code Red
 
  
  Trojan horse :-
   - Malicious program that unexpected changes to computer setting and unusual activity, even when computer should idle  
   - Appear as normal application but when opened/executed some malicious code will run in background
   - Cannot replicate itself
   - Often contain spying function(such as packet sniffer) or backdoor that allow computer to be remotely controlled
   - Often is hidden in useful software such as screen savers or games
   Ex : Back Orifice, Net Bus, Whack-a-Mole


  Backdoors :-
   - Bypasses normal authentication process 
   - Developer create backdoor so that application or OS accessed for troubleshooting  or other purposes
  

  Bots/Robot :-
   - Automated process that interacts with other network services
   - Some run automatically while other only execute when receive specific input 
   Ex :- Crawler, Chatroom  bots and malicious bots


  Logic Bomb :-
   - Malware that lies dormant until triggered
   - Example of asynchronous attack
   - Trigger activity may be specific date and time, launching specific program or processing specific type of activity
   - Do not self-replicate

 
 Active attacks :- 
  - Network exploit in which hacker attempts to make change to data on target or data en route to target
  
  Masquerade :- 
   - Intruder pretend to be particular user of system to gain access or to gain greater privileges than they authorized
   - Masquerade attempted through stolen login IDs and passwords, finding security gaps in programs or 
     through bypassing authentication mechanism
  
  Session replay :- 
   - Hacker steal authorized user’s log in information by stealing session ID
   - Intruder gains access and ability to do anything that authorized user can do on website

  Message modification :-  
   - Intruder alters packet header addresses to direct message to different destination or modify data on target machine
  
  Denial of service(DoS) :-  
   - Users deprived of access to network or web resource 
   - Accomplished by overwhelming target with more traffic than it handle

  Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) :- 
   - Exploit large numbers of compromised system(botnet or zombie army) attack single target

 
 Passive Attack :-
  - Scarce from classification perspective but carried out with relative ease, particularly if traffic not encrypted
 
  Eavesdropping(tapping) :- 
   - Attacker listen to messages exchanged by two entities
   - Unencrypted information such password sent in response to HTTP request, may be retrieved by attacker.
 
  Traffic analysis :- 
   - Attacker looks at metadata transmitted in traffic in order to deduce information relating to exchange and 
     participating entities
   - In cases where encrypted data used traffic analysis lead to attacks by ecryptanalysis whereby attacker obtain 
     information or succeed in unencrypting traffic
  
  Software Attacks :- 
   - Malicious code(malware) type of software designed to take over or damage computer user's os without user's 
     knowledge or approval 
   - Difficult to remove and very damaging 
 
 
 Hardware Attack :- 
  - Affect embedded radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips and memory 
  - Eavesdropping :- Gaining access to protected memory without opening other hardware 
  - Inducing faults causing interruption of normal behaviour 
  - Hardware modification tampering with invasive operations 
  - Backdoor creation presence of hidden methods for bypassing normal computer authentication system
  - Counterfeiting product asset that produce extraordinary operation and those gain malicious access to system

  - Accidental threats involve employee error technical malfunction or event that causes physical damage such as fire
    or natural disaster

 
 Vulnerabilities :-
  - Gaps or weaknesses in system that make threat possible and tempt threat actor to exploit them
  - When threat probability multiplied by potential loss that may result, cyber security experts refer to this as risk
  Types :- SQL injection | Server Misconfiguration | Cross-site Scripting | Transmitting sensitive data in non-
           encrypted plain text format
  Categories :-
   Corrupted (Loss of integrity) | Leaky (Loss of confidentiality) | Unavailable or very slow (Loss of availability) 
 
 
 – Threat represent potential security harm to asset when vulnerabilities are exploited 
  Attacks are threats that have been carried out :-
   Passive  - Use information from system without affecting system resource
   Active   - Alter system resources or affect operation 
   Insider  - Initiated by entity inside organization  
   Outsider - Initiated from outside perimeter


 Cyber criminals :-
  - Access to enormous amounts of hardware, software, and data
  - They have potential to cripple much of effective business and government throughout world 
  - One approach to prevention to understand who commit these crime and why
  - Many studies have attempted to determine the characteristics of computer criminals
  - By sudying those future to spot likely criminals and prevent crimes from occurring

  Motive of attackers :- 
   inadvertent action :- Insiders that taken without malicious or harmful intent 
   deliberate action  :- insiders or outsiders taken intentionally and are meant to do harm 
                         Political  |  Economical  | Socio-Cultural
   inaction :- Insider such as failure to act in given situation either because of lack skills, knowledge, 
  
 
  Cyber Threats-Cyber Warfare | Cyber Crime | Cyber Espionage :- 
   - Cyber warfare involve action by nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another
     nation's computers or information network through Ex :- computer viruses or denial-of-service attack
   - Cybercrime is criminal activity that doing by individuals or organizations by either target computer network or 
     networked device for make money 
   - Cyber spying or cyber espionage act or practice of obtaining secrets and information without permission and 
     knowledge of holder of information from

   - Never give out personal information to stranger
   - Check security settings to prevent cybercrime 
   - Using antivirus software
   - When visiting unauthorized websites, keep your information secure
   - Use virtual private networks (VPNs) : Hide our IP addresses
   - Restriction on access to your most valuable data



Security Policies :- 
 - Set of rules which issued by organization to ensure that user who authorized to access company technology and 
   information assets comply with rules and guidelines related to security of information
 - "living document" means document never finished but it continuously updated as requirement of technology 
 - It manage network security 
 - Most policies are automatically created during installation  
 Need :- Efficiency  |  Discipline and accountability  |  Educate employees on security literacy            

 Virus and Spyware Protection policy :- 
  - Helps to detect threads in files to detect application that exhibits suspicious behavior
  - Remove and repairs side effect of viruses and security risks by using signatures
 
 Firewall Policy :- 
  - Blocks unauthorized users from accessing system and network that connect to Internet
  - Detect attacks by cybercriminals and removes unwanted sources of network traffic

 Intrusion Prevention policy :- 
  - Automatically detect and blocks network attacks and browser attack
  - Also protect application from vulnerabilities and check contents of one or more data packages and detects malware
    which coming through legal ways
 
 Application and Device Control :- 
  - Protect system's resources from application and manage peripheral devices that attach to system
  - Device control policy applies to both Windows and Mac computers whereas application control policy applied only
    to Windows client
