What is Unix?
 - Unix OS is set of programs that act as link between computer and user
 - Users communicate with kernel through program known as shell 
 - Shell is command line interpreter translate commands entered by user into language that understood by kernel
 - Developed in 1969 by AT&T employees Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna at Bell Lab
 - Multiuser system and multitasking environment

 Unix Architecture :-
  Kernel - Heart of OS interact with hardware and perform memory management, task scheduling and file management
  Shell  - Command line interpreter translate command into kernal language | C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell 
  Command and Utilities - Use in day to day activities | 250 command plus numerous others provided through 3rd party
  Files and Directories - Data of Unix organized into files then organized into directories than tree-like structure
                          called filesystem


 System Bootup :-
  Login Unix - 
    login: user name(Case-sensitive)
    password : 
  
 
 Command :-
  cal - Show calender
  
  Change Password :-
    passwd
    (current) Unix password : 
    New UNIX password : 
    Retype new UNIX password : 
    passwd : all authentication tokens updated successfully

  Listing Directories and Files :- 
   - Data -> File -> Directories -> File System  

   ls - List out all files or directories available in directory
   
  
  whoami - Find out "who you are" currently login | List account name associated with current login
  
  Who is Logged in? 
   users - Show all user in system
   who   - Show username with login time

  Logout - Logout form system will clean up everything and break session

 
 System Shutdown :- 
  - Super user or root user need to shut down system
  halt - Brings system down immediately
  init 0 - Powers off system using predefined script to synchronize and clean up system prior to shutting down
  init 6 - Reboot system by shutting it down completely then restarting it
  poweroff - Shut down system by powering off
  reboot   - Reboot system
  shutdown - Shuts down system
  


Unix Basic Utilities - Printing, Email 
 Printing File :-
  pr - Does minor formatting of files on terminal screen or for printer 
  lp / lpr     - Print file onto paper
  lpstat / lpq - Show what's in printer queue :- request IDs, owners, file sizes, status of request
  cancel - Terminate printing request from lp command 
  lprm   - Terminate all lpr request 
  
 Sending Email :-
  - $mail [-s subject] [-c cc-addr] [-b bcc-addr] to-addr
    -s :- Specifies subject on command line
    -c :- Send carbon copies to list of users, List commaseparated list of name
    -b :- Send blind carbon copies to list
  
  Ex :- $mail -s "Test Message" admin@yahoo.com
        $mail -s "Report 05/06/07" admin@yahoo.com < demo.txt 
  
  - Check incoming email :- mail



Unix - System Performance
 Unix has following major resource types that need to be monitored and tuned :-
  CPU | Memory | Disk space | Communications lines | I/O Time | Network Time | Applications programs

 Performance Component :-
  User State CPU   - Amount of time CPU spend for running user program
  System State CPU - Amount of time CPU spend in system state on behalf of System program
  I/O Time and Network Time  - Time spent for moving data and servicing I/O request
  Virtual Memory Performance - Includes context switching and swapping
  
  
 Performance Tools :- 
  ps     - Report snapshot of current processes
  top    - Display system tasks
  prof   - Facilitate Process Profiling
  time   - Help time simple command or give resource usage
  gprof  - Display call graph profile data
  uptime - System Load Average
  vmstat - Report virtual memory statistics
  netstat     - Print network and masquerade connection, routing table, interface statistic, multicast membership
  nice/renice - Run program with modified scheduling priority
