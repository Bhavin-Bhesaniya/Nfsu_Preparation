Unix - Regular Expressions with SED(Stream Editor)
 - String that used to describe several sequences of characters
 - Used by different Unix command including ed, sed, awk, grep, and to a more limited extent, vi
 - Stream-oriented editor was created exclusively for executing script 
 

 Invoking SED :
  - Before we start, let us ensure we have a local copy of /etc/passwd text file to work with sed.
  Syntax :- $ cat /etc/passwd | sed
  Usage  :- sed [OPTION]... {script-other-script} [input-file]...
  - cat command dump content of /etc/passwd to sed through pipe into sed's pattern space 
  

  SED General Syntax :- /pattern/action
   - Pattern is regular expression and action is one of commands 
   - Slash character (/) that surrounds the pattern are required because they are used as delimiters.

  
  SED Addresses :-
   - Addresses either particular location in file or range where particular editing command should be applied
   - When sed encounters no addresses, it perform its operation on every line in file
   Syntax :- cat /etc/passwd | sed '1d' |more


 Substitution Command :-
  - Denoted by s will substitute any string that specify with any other string that you specify
  - To substitute one string with another sed need to have information on where first string end and substitution 
    string begins 
  - For this proceed with bookending two strings with forward slash (/) character
  Syntax :- cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/root/amrood/'
  
  
 Matching Command :-
  - Use p option along with -n to print all matching lines
  Syntax :- $ cat testing | sed -n '/root/p'


 Using Regular Expression :-
    ^   Matches beginning of lines
    $   Matches the end of lines
    .   Matches any single character
    *   Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character
    [chars] Matches any one of the characters given in chars, where chars is a sequence of characters
            . You can use the - character to indicate a range of characters.

 
 Matching Characters :-
    /a.c/       Lines that contain strings such as a+c, a-c, abc, match, and a3c
    /a*c/       Same strings along with strings such as ace, yacc, and arctic
    /[tT]he/    Matche string The and the
    /^$/        Blank lines
    /^.*$/      Entire line whatever it is
    / */        One or more spaces
    [a-z]       Single lowercase letter
    [A-Z]       Single uppercase letter
    [a-zA-Z]    Single letter
    [0-9]       Single number
    [a-zA-Z0-9] Single letter or number


 Character Class Keywords :-
  - Some special keyword available to regexps especially GNU utilities that employ regexps 
  - Using alphabet character class keyword, print only those lines in /etc/syslog.conf file that start with a letter
    of alphabet 
  Ex :- $ cat /etc/syslog.conf | sed -n '/^[[:alpha:]]/p'
    [[:alnum:]]     Alphanumeric [a-z A-Z 0-9]
    [[:alpha:]]     Alphabetic [a-z A-Z]
    [[:blank:]]     Blank characters (spaces or tabs)
    [[:cntrl:]]     Control characters
    [[:digit:]]     Numbers [0-9]
    [[:graph:]]     Any visible characters (excludes whitespace)
    [[:lower:]]     Lowercase letters [a-z]
    [[:print:]]     Printable characters (non-control characters)
    [[:punct:]]     Punctuation characters
    [[:space:]]     Whitespace
    [[:upper:]]     Uppercase letters [A-Z]
    [[:xdigit:]]    Hex digits [0-9 a-f A-F]
