Intro to Physical Layer :-
 - Last layer from sender side and top layer in receiver side
 - Provide functionality to data-link layer
 - When all bits come from data-link layer, physical-layer send it using transmission media like guided-unguided media
 - Physical Layer deals with hardware
 - Convert logical data into signal

 Functionality :-
  Cabels and Connectors    - Twisted, Co-axial, Optical Fibers used to send data on signal 
                             BNC, MGRT, UTP Connectors (Join Cabel)
  Physical Topology        - How to Connect physical devices and Configuration? (Star, Mesh, Bus, Point-To-Point) 
  Hardware(Repeaters, Hub) - Increase signal strength | Hub for multipoint connection
  Transmission mode        - Simplex-mode(One way data send), Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex
  Encoding                 - Send data to either analog or digital signal
  Multiplexing/ Demultiplexing - 
   - If machine increase on same Channel not need to create new channel use existing channel using time division 
   - Send N number of signal to single signal to send 
   - Convert 1 signal to N no. of signal



Various Device in computer network :-
 Cabel :-
  - Connect variou device which are physically separated
  - Transfer data through packets or signal form

  Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cabel :- 
   - Transfer data in form of electric signal
   - 10 Base T / 100 Base T
   - 10 means 10 MBPS(Mega Bit Per Second) data can be transfer per second
   Base has two types :-
    BaseBrand :- Only one signal transmit at a time if other signal come collision arise
    BroadBand :- Multiple signal can be parallel transmit
   - T means only 100 meter signal can be transmit than attuention occurs(Signal strength week)
   - Use in Ethernet LAN

  Coaxial Cabel :-
   - Transfer data in form of electric signal
   - 10 Base 2 / 10 Base 5
   - 2 and 5 means 200 and 500 meter distance

  Fiber Optice :- 
   - Transfer data in form of light Signal
   - Speed of light signal is - 3x10^8
   - 100 Base Fx 
   - Fx means fiber channel which cover 2km distance 

  Question :- 
    If N devices connect on network, what is maximum collision domain ? --> N
    Cable can filter or not :- 
      - If Two Lan connected it can move signal or not
      - Filter means can we decied it can move further or not
    Ans :- Yes, there is no software in cabel



 Repeater :-
  - Works on physical layer pure hardware
  - Increase strength distance of weak signal means Regenerate Strength of signal
  - Amplifier also do this but if starting signal strength is X and it goes down Amplifier increases it 2x or 4x 
    while repeater strength will be same x -> x 
  - 2 port devices forwarding signal but not supporting filtering and maximum collision is N



 Hub :-
  - Multi-Point Repeater Hardware device
  - Provide small blink light functionality if any wire problem Occure or power on or off which repeater not provide
  - Support forwarding but not supporting filtering so high traffic which become collision domain problem



 Bridges :- 
  - 2 Port devices used to Connect two different LAN's works on physical and data-link layer
  - Support forwarding
  - Bridges can check MAC address means decided that packets send to forward or not



 Switches :-
  - Layer-2 (Data-Link Layer) device
  - Multi-Port Bridges
  - Full Duplex Link
  - Traffic is minimal
  - Collision Domain is Zero(0)



 Routers :-
  - Used to connect two different network
  - 



 Gateway
 IDS
 Firewall
 Modem
