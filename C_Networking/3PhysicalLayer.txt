Transmission Media :-
 - Transmission medium is physical path between transmitter and receiver 
 - It is channel through data sent from one place to another
  
 Types of Transmission Media :-
  Guided Media :-
   - Referred as Wired or Bounded transmission media
   - Signals transmitted are directed and confined in narrow pathway by using physical links

      - Digital signalling                                  - Analog signalling
      - Frequency division multiplexing is not possible     - Possible
      - Baseband is bi-directional transmission             - unidirectional
      - Short distance signal travelling                    - long
      - Entire bandwidth is for single signal transmission  - Simultaneous multiple signals different frequencies
      - Ethernet is using Basebands for LAN                 - Used to transmit cable TV to premises


    Shielded Twisted-Pair(STP) :-
     - Consists of special jacket(copper braid covering or foil shield) to block external interference
     - Used in fast-data-rate Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines
     - Higher data rate compare to UTP | Eliminates Cross Talk | More Expensive | Diffcult to install


   Coaxial Cable :-
    - Outer plastic covering insulation layer made of PVC or Teflon and 2 parallel conductors each having separate 
      insulated protection cover
    - Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables
    - High Bandwidth | Better noise Immunity | Easy to install and expand | Inexpensive
    - Single cable failure disrupt entire network

    Base has two types :-
      BaseBrand :- Only one signal transmit at time if other signal come collision arise(Dedicated cable bandwidth)
      BroadBand :- Multiple signal can be parallel transmit and cable bandwidth split into separate ranges   


   Optical Fiber Cable :-
    - Uses concept of reflection of light through core made up of glass or plastic
    - Core is surrounded by less dense glass or plastic covering called cladding
    - Used for transmission of large volumes of data 
    - Cable can be unidirectional or bidirectional
    - WDM(Wavelength Division Multiplexer) support both direction
    - Increased capacity and bandwidth | Lighweight | Less signal attenuation 
    - Diffcult to install and maintain | High Cost  | Fragile


   Stripline :-
    - Transverse electromagnetic(TEM) transmission line medium invented by Robert M. Barrett of Air Force Cambridge
      Research Centre in 1950
    - Earliest form of planar transmission line

  Unguided Media :-
   - Referred as Wireless or Unbounded transmission media 
   - No physical medium required for transmission of electromagnetic signals
   - Less Secure | Used for larger distances | Signal broadcasted through air
   
   Radio Waves :-
    - Easy to generate and penetrate through buildings 
    - Sending and receiving through antennas
    - Frequency Range:3KHz – 1GHz 
    - AM and FM radios and cordless phones use Radio waves for transmission
    - Further Categorized as (i) Terrestrial and (ii) Satellite

Transmission mode :-
 - Transferring data between two devices also known as Communication / Directional mode
 - Buses and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected
 - Defined in Physical layer

 Simplex Mode :-
  - Communication is unidirectional 
  - Device can only send data but cannot receive at same time
  - Use entire capacity of channel to send data in one direction so more data transmitted
  - Unidirectional so No inter-communication between devices
  Example : Keyboard and Monitors | Radio 
 

 Half-Duplex Mode :-
  - Both transmit and receive but not at same time 
  - When one device is sending other can only receive and vice versa 
  - Entire capacity of channel utilized for each direction at time
  - It possible to perform error detection
  Channel capacity  = Bandwidth * Propagation Delay
  Example : In Walkie-talkie message sent one at time and messages are sent in both direction

 
 Full-Duplex Mode :-
  - Bi-directional where Both device transmit and receive data simultaneously 
  - Channel capacity must be divided between two directions
  - Signal go in one direction share capacity of link with signal going in other direction this sharing occur two ways:- 
    - Link contain two physically separate transmission path one for sending and other for receiving
    - Capacity divided between signals traveling in both direction
  Channel Capacity  = 2 * Bandwidth * Propagation Delay
  Example :- Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by telephone line




Signal Conversion :-
 Digital Signal : 
  - Represents data as sequence of discrete values at any given time it can only take on one of finite number of values

 Analog Signal :- 
  - Signal is any continuous signal for which time varying feature of signal is representation of some other time
    varying quantity i.e., analogous to another time varying signal


 Analog to Digital Signal :-
 
  Pulse Code Modulation(PCM):-
   - Change analog signal to digital data
   Process :- Sampling | Quantization | Encoding
   
   Low Pass Filter :-
    - Eliminates high frequency component present in input analog signal to ensure that input signal sampler is free
      from unwanted frequency components
    - This is done to avoid aliasing of message signal
   

   Sampling :-
    - Process of measuring amplitude of continuous-time signal at discrete instants
    - Converting continuous signal into discrete signal
    Idel Sampling    :- Known as Instantaneous sampling pulses from analog signal are sampled
    Natural Sampling :- 
     - Practical method of sampling in which pulse have finite width equal to T
     - Result is sequence of samples that retain shape of analog signal
    Flat Top Sampling :- Top of samples remains constant by using circuit

    Nyquist Theorem :-
     - Sampling rate must be at least 2 times highest frequency contained in signal 
     - Also known as minimum sampling rate and given by :- Fs = 2 * fh
   
   
   Quantization :-
    - Sampling is series of pulses with amplitude values between maximum and minimum amplitudes of signal 
    - Set of amplitudes infinite with non-integral values between two limits
    - D = (Vmax - Vmin) / L
    - Normalized pulse amplitude modulation(PAM) value is calculated using formula :- amplitude / d


   Encoding :-
    - Digitization of analog signal is done by encoder 
    - After each sample is quantized and number of bits per sample is decided each sample changed to n bit code 
    - Encoding also minimizes bandwidth used



  DELTA MODULATION :-
    - Find change from previous value
    Modulator :- 
     - Used at sender site to create stream of bits from analog signal 
     - Process records small positive change called delta 
     - If delta is positive process records a 1 else process records a 0 
     - It build second signal that resembles staircase 
     - Input signal is then compared with this gradually made staircase signal
     Rules :- 
      - Input analog signal higher than lastvalue of staircase signal increase delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 1
      - Input analog signal lower than lastvalue of staircase signal decrease delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 0



  ADAPTIVE DELTA MODULATION(ADM):-
    - Performance of delta modulator improved significantly by making step size of modulator assume time-varying form 
    - Larger step-size is needed where message has steep slope of modulating signal 
    - Smaller step-size is needed where message has small slope and Size is adapted according to level of input signal 
      these method knows as ADM    



 Digital to Analog conversion :-
  Amplitude Shift Keying :-
   - Carrier signal is analog and data to be modulated is digital 
   - Aanalog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data
   - Binary signal gives zero value when binary data represent 0 while gives carrier output when data is 1 
   - Frequency and phase of carrier signal remain constant
   - Transmit digital data over optical fiber | 
   - Receiver and transmitter have simple design which makes it comparatively inexpensive
   - Offer high bandwidth efficiency
   - Susceptible to noise interference and entire transmissions could be lost due to this | Lower Power Efficiency


  Frequency Shift Keying :-
  Phase Shift Keying :-  
   Binary Phase Shift Keying(BPSK) :-
   Quadrature Shift Keying(QPSK) :-


 
 Analog to Analog Conversion :-  
  - Representation of analog information by analog signal
  Amplitude Modulation
  Frequency Modulation
  Phase Modulation




Wireless Communication :- 
 - Data travel through air, there must be some constraints within which wireless communication takes place    
 - All wireless devices must follow a common standard i.e, IEEE 802.11
 - Wireless coverage must be there where devices are expected to use
 - Wired network under IEEE standard 802.3 while wireless network under IEEE standard 802.11
 - IEEE stands for "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers" is an organization composed of engineers 
   that issues and manages standards for electrical and electronic devices


 Basic of Wireless Communication :-
  - Takes places through RF(radio frequency) one device Transmitter send signal to other device Receiver 
  - Two devices (transmitter and receiver) must use same frequency (or channel) to be able to communicate 
  - If large number of wireless devices communicate at same time radio frequency cause interference with each other
  - Interference increases as no of devices increases
  - All wireless devices operate in half duplex mode to avoid collision or interference
  - To achieve full duplex mode, devices uses different frequency or channel of transmission and receiving of signal
  - wireless communication is Full-duplex but technically it is not



 Radio Frequency :-
  - Sender(transmitter) send alternating current into section of wire(antenna) 
  - This sets up moving electric and magnetic field that away as travelling waves 
  - Electric and magnetic field moves along each other at right angle to each other 
  - Signal must keep changing or alternating by cycle up and down to keep electric and magnetic field cyclic and 
    pushing forward 
  - No of cycles wave taking in second is called Frequency of wave
  So :- frequency = no of cycles per second  
  - Electromagnetic waves not travel in straight line 
  - They travel by expanding in all direction away from antenna
  
  Unit	    Abbreviation	Meaning
   Hertz	    Hz        	Cycles per second
   Kilohertz	KHz	        1000 Hz
   Megahertz	MHz	        1,000,000 Hz
   Gigahertz	GHz	        1,000,000,000 Hz



 Basic Service Set(BSS):-
  - To regulate connection to devices, make every wireless service area closed group of mobile devices that form
    around fixed device
  - IEEE calls this standard BSS
  - At center of every BSS there is access point (AP), it Provide services that are necessary to form infrastructure 
    of Wireless communication 
  - AP operates in infrastructure mode and uses single wireless channel 
  - All devices that want to connect to AP must use that same channel
  - Because operation of BSS depends on AP BSS is bounded to area covered by AP 
  - Area up to which AP’s signal is reachable, This area is called Basic Service Area (BSA) or cell 
  - Cell is usually circular shape with center as AP 
  - AP serves as single point of contact for BSS 
  - AP use unique BSS identifier(BSSID) based on its own MAC address to advertise it’s existence to all devices in cell
  - AP also advertises human-readable text string called Service Set identifier(SSID) to uniquely identify AP 
  - BSSID as machine-readable unique tag to identify wireless service and SSID human-readable service tag
  - Membership of mobile devices with BSS is called Association 
  - Once associated device becomes BSS client or 802.11 station (STA) 
  - As long as devices connected to AP all data communication passes through AP using BSSID as source and destination
    address 
  - You can think why all traffic must pass through AP? 
  - They simply communicate with other devices directly without AP as middleman
  - If we don’t do so then whole point of wireless service will go in vain 
  - Sending data through AP make it stable and controllable



 Repeater :-
  - AP in wireless infrastructure usually connected back to switched networks 
  - BSS has limited signal coverage area(BSA) 
  - To extend signal coverage add additional AP but in some scenarios not possible, Solution is Repeater
  - Repeater is just AP configured in Repeater mode 
  - Wireless repeater takes signal as input and retransmits signals in new cell around Repeater 
  - Repeater uses two transmitters and receiver to keep original and repeated signals isolated on different channel



 
Manchester encoding and differential manchester encoding :-
 - Transmission of data means convert upper layer digital data(0,1 form) to analog or digital signal
 - To encode data digital to digital we use manchester and differential manchester encoding
 - Dr.thomas and IEEE802.3 convention
 Manchester :-
  0 -->  -|_
  1 -->  _|-

 Different Manchester Encoding :-
  0 --> |-|_ , |_|- 
  1 --> -|_  , _|-




Scrambling in Digital electronic :-
 - Signal that represent data also be digital or analog
 - To send signal must convert data into signal 
 - This conversion can be Analog to Analog, Analog to Digital, Digital to Analog or Digital to Digital
 - Digital to Digital conversion involves three techniques – Line Coding, Block Coding, and Scrambling 
 - Line Coding always needed whereas Block Coding and Scrambling depending upon need
 - Scrambling not increase number of bits and provide synchronization 
 - Problem with technique like Bipolar AMI(Alternate Mark Inversion) is that continuous sequence of zero’s create 
   synchronization problems one solution to this is Scrambling
 

 Types of Line Coding :-
  - Self-synchronizing both receiver and sender clock should be synchronized
  - Error-detecting capability and less complexity

  Unipolar 
   - Non Return to Zero(NRZ) positive voltage defines bit 1 and the zero voltage defines bit 0
   - Signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit thus it is called NRZ
   - Uses more power as compared to polar scheme to send one bit per unit line resistance

  Polar (eg. NRZ-L, NRZ-I, RZ, and Biphase – Manchester and differential Manchester)
   - NRZ-L and NRZ-I similar to Unipolar but use two levels of amplitude (voltages)
   - Return to Zero(RZ) uses three values positive, negative and zero

  Bipolar (eg. AMI and Pseudoternary) | ultilevel | Multitransition
 


 Scrambling Techniques :-
  B8ZS(Bipolar with 8-zero substitution) :-
   - Similar to Bipolar AMI except when eight consecutive zero-level voltages are encountered they are replaced by 
     sequence "000VB0VB"
   - V(Violation) is non-zero voltage which means signal have same polarity as previous non-zero voltage
   - B(Bipolar) also non-zero voltage level which is accordance with AMI rule


  HDB3(High-density bipolar3-zero) :-
   - Four consecutive zero-level voltages are replaced with sequence “000V” or “B00V”
