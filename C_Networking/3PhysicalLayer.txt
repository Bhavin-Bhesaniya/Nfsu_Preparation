Intro to Physical Layer :-
 - Last layer from sender side and top layer in receiver side deal with hardware
 - Provide functionality to data-link layer
 - When all bits come from data-link layer, physical-layer send it using transmission media like guided-unguided media
 - Convert logical data into signal
 - Contain information in the form of bits 
 - Responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to next

 Functionality :-
  Cabels and Connectors    - Twisted, Co-axial, Optical Fibers used to send data on signal 
                             BNC, MGRT, UTP Connectors (Join Cabel)
  Physical Topology        - How to Connect physical devices and Configuration? (Star, Mesh, Bus, Point-To-Point) 
  Hardware(Repeaters, Hub) - Increase signal strength | Hub for multipoint connection
  Transmission mode        - Simplex-mode(One way data send), Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex
  Encoding                 - Send data to either analog or digital signal
  Multiplexing/ Demultiplexing - 
   - If machine increase on same Channel not need to create new channel use existing channel using time division 
   - Send N number of signal to single signal to send 
   - Convert 1 signal to N no. of signal




Transmission mode :-
 - Transferring data between two devices also known as Communication / Directional mode
 - Buses and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected
 - Defined in Physical layer

 Simplex Mode :-
  - Communication is unidirectional 
  - Device can only send data but cannot receive at same time
  - Use entire capacity of channel to send data in one direction so more data transmitted
  - Unidirectional so No inter-communication between devices
  Example : Keyboard and Monitors | Radio 
 

 Half-Duplex Mode :-
  - Both transmit and receive but not at same time 
  - When one device is sending other can only receive and vice versa 
  - Entire capacity of channel utilized for each direction at time
  - It possible to perform error detection
  Channel capacity  = Bandwidth * Propagation Delay
  Example : In Walkie-talkie message sent one at time and messages are sent in both direction

 
 Full-Duplex Mode :-
  - Bi-directional where Both device transmit and receive data simultaneously 
  - Channel capacity must be divided between two directions
  - Signal go in one direction share capacity of link with signal going in other direction this sharing occur two ways:- 
    - Link contain two physically separate transmission path one for sending and other for receiving
    - Capacity divided between signals traveling in both direction
  Channel Capacity  = 2 * Bandwidth * Propagation Delay
  Example :- Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by telephone line




Digital Transmission / Signal Conversion :- 
 - Signal that represent data in either digital or analog form
 - To send data must convert into signal 
 - It may be Analog to Analog, Analog to Digital, Digital to Analog or Digital to Digital
 
 Digital Signal : 
  - Represent data as sequence of discrete value at any given time and take only on one of finite number of values

 Analog Signal :- 
  - Signal is any continuous signal for which time varying feature of signal is representation of some other time
    varying quantity i.e., analogous to another time varying signal

 
 Digital-to-Digital :-
  - Digital to Digital conversion involves three techniques – Line Coding, Block Coding, and Scrambling 
  Line Coding :- 
   - Always needed whereas Block Coding and Scrambling depending upon need
   - Self-synchronizing both receiver and sender clock should be synchronized
   - Error-detecting capability and less complexity
  
  Scrambling  :- 
   - Not increase number of bits and provide synchronization 
   - Problem with Bipolar AMI(Alternate Mark Inversion) is that continuous sequence of zero’s create synchronization 
     problems one solution to this is Scrambling
 

  Types of Digital-to-Digital encoding :-
  Unipolar :-
   - Non Return to Zero(NRZ) positive voltage defines bit 1 and zero voltage defines bit 0
   - Signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit thus it is called NRZ
   - Uses more power as compared to polar scheme to send one bit per unit line resistance
   - Polarity assigned to 1 binary state
   Problem :- DC Component  |  Synchronization


  Polar :-
   - Uses two voltage levels :- one positive and another is negative
   - By using two voltage level average voltage level reduced and DC component problem is alleviated   
   Types :- NRZ (NRZ-L)(NRZ-I)  |  RZ  |  BIPHASE(Manchester)(Different Manchester) 


   NRZ(Non-Return Zero):-
    - level of signal represented either positive or negative    
    NRZ-L :- Level of signal depend on type of bit that it represent Either 0(Positive) and 1(Negative)
    NRZ-I :- Inversion of voltage level that represent in bit, 0 no change and 1 bit represent change voltage level


   RZ(Return to Zero) :- 
    - Use three values positive, negative and zero for signal change of each bit to achieve synchronization
    - 1 bit is represented by positive-to-zero and 0 bit is represented by negative-to-zero  

   
   BIPHASE(Manchester and differential manchester encoding) :- 
    - Transmission of data means convert upper layer digital data(0,1 form) to analog or digital signal
    - To encode data digital to digital we use manchester and differential manchester encoding
    - Dr.thomas and IEEE802.3 convention
    
    Manchester :-
      0 -->  -|_
      1 -->  _|-

    Different Manchester Encoding :-
      0 --> |-|_ , |_|- 
      1 --> -|_  , _|-

  
  Bipolar :- AMI and Pseudoternary  |  Ultilevel  |  Multitransition
   - Represent three voltage levels: positive, negative, and zero 
   - Binary 0 represent Zero level and 1 represented by alternating positive and negative voltage
   - If first 1 bit represented by positive amplitude then second 1 bit represented by negative voltage 
     third 1 bit by positive amplitude and so on
   Types :- AMI  |  B8ZS  |  HDB3

   AMI(Alternative Mark Inversion) :- 
    - Mark work comes from telegraphy which means 1 So it redefined as alternate 1 inversion
    - 0 bit represented by zero level and 1 bit represented by alternating positive and negative voltages
    - DC Component Zero  |  Sequence of 1s bits are synchronized
    - Not ensure synchronization of long string of 0s bits
   

   B8ZS(Bipolar with 8-zero substitution) :-
    - Similar to AMI except when eight consecutive zero-level voltage encountered they replaced by sequence "000VB0VB"
    - V(Violation) is non-zero voltage which means signal have same polarity as previous non-zero voltage
    - B(Bipolar) also non-zero voltage level which is accordance with AMI rule

     - Also known as minimum sampling rate and given by :- Fs = 2 * fh
   
   
   Quantization :-
    - Process of assigning integral values in specific range to sampled instances
    - D = (Vmax - Vmin) / L
    - Normalized pulse amplitude modulation(PAM) value is calculated using formula :- amplitude / d


   Encoding :-
    - Digitization of analog signal is done by encoder but it also minimizes bandwidth used


  DELTA MODULATION :-
   - Find change from previous value
   Modulator :- 
    - Used at sender site to create stream of bits from analog signal 
    - Process records small positive change called delta 
    - If delta is positive process records a 1 else process records a 0 
    - It build second signal that resembles staircase 
    - Input signal is then compared with this gradually made staircase signal
    Rules :- 
     - Input analog signal higher than lastvalue of staircase signal increase delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 1
     - Input analog signal lower than lastvalue of staircase signal decrease delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 0



  ADAPTIVE DELTA MODULATION(ADM):-
   - Performance of delta modulator improved significantly by making step size of modulator assume time-varying form 
   - Larger step-size is needed where message has steep slope of modulating signal 
   - Smaller step-size is needed where message has small slope and Size is adapted according to level of input signal 
     these method knows as ADM    



 Digital to Analog conversion :-
  Amplitude Shift Keying :-
   - Carrier signal is analog and data to be modulated is digital

 Cause of Transmission impairment :-
  Attenuation :- Strength of signal decreases with increasing distance which causes loss of energy
  Distortion  :- 
   - Occure When signal shape is change 
   - It Examined from different signals having different frequencies

   Basic Service Set(BSS):-
    - To regulate connection to devices, make every wireless service area closed group of mobile devices that form
      around fixed device IEEE calls this standard BSS
    - AP serves single point of contact for BSS 
    - AP use unique BSS identifier(BSSID) on its own MAC address to advertise it’s existence to all devices in cell
    - Also advertises human-readable text string called Service Set identifier(SSID) to uniquely identify AP 
    - Membership of mobile devices with BSS is called Association 
    - Once associated device becomes BSS client or 802.11 station (STA) 
    - As long device connect to AP all data communication pass through AP using BSSID as source and destination address 
    - Sending data through AP make it stable and controllable

    - Repeater is just AP configured in Repeater mode 
    - Wireless repeater takes signal as input and retransmits signals in new cell around Repeater 
    - Repeater uses two transmitters and receiver to keep original and repeated signals isolated on different channel

 

Multiplexing / Demultiplexing :-
 
 Multiplexing :-
  - Process of combining and send multiple data streams over single medium known as multiplexing and hardware used for
    multiplexing known as multiplexer.
  - Multiplexer(MUX) combine n input lines to generate single output line 
  - Multiplexing follows many-to-one(N input lines one output line)
 

 Demultiplexing :-
  - Achieved using device called Demultiplexer(DEMUX) available at receiving end 
  - DEMUX separate signal into its component signals(one input and n outputs) 
  - Demultiplexing follows one-to-many approach

 
 Why Multiplexing?
  - At time only one signal can transfer from sender to receiver in transmission medium
  - If multiple signal to share on medium then medium must be divided in such way that each signal given some portion
    of available bandwidth  
  - When multiple signals share common medium there is possibility of collision
  - Multiplexing concept used to avoid such collision

 
 History of Multiplexing :-
  - Multiplexing used in telecommunications in which several telephone calls are carried through single wire
  - It originated in telegraphy in early 1870s and now widely used in communication
  - George Owen Squier developed telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910

  Diagram :- https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/concept-of-multiplexing.png

  Advantages of Multiplexing :- 
   - More than one signal sent over single medium
   - Medium bandwidth utilized effectively


 
 Multiplexing Techniques :-
                            Multiplexing
  Frequency-division    Wavelength Division          Time-Division
    Multiplexing          Multiplexing                Multiplexing
                                            Synchronous TDM   Asynchronous TDM

 
 Frequency-division Multiplexing (FDM) :-
  - Subdivide available bandwidth into different frequency channels and allocate them to different devices
  - Device 1 has frequency channel of range from 1 to 5
  - Input signal translated into frequency band using modulation technique and combine by multiplexerto composite signal
  - Using modulation input signals are transmitted into frequency bands and then combined to form a composite signal
  - Carrier which used for modulating signals are known as sub-carriers and represented as f1,f2..fn
  - Mainly used in radio broadcasts and TV networks

  Advantages :-
   - Used for analog signal | Simple and easy modulation | Large no. of signal sent simultaneously 
   - Not require synchronization between sender and receiver

  Disadvantages :-
   - Used only when low-speed channels required | Suffer problem of crosstalk | Large number of modulators required
   - Require high bandwidth channel
 

 
 Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) :-
  - Same as FDM except that optical signals are transmitted through fibre optic cable to increase it capacity
  - Utilize high data rate capability of fibre optic cable
  - Optical signals combined with help of multiplexer and separates at receiver end using demultiplexer
  - Multiplexing and Demultiplexing achieved by using prism
  - Prism perform role of multiplexer by combining various optical signal to form composite signal and composite signal
    is transmitted through fibre optical cable
  - Prism also perform reverse operation, i.e., demultiplexing signal.


 
 Time Division Multiplexing(TDM) :-
  - Digital technique in which all signals operate at same frequency with different time
  - Total time available in channel is distributed among different users 
  - Therefore each user allocated with different time interval known as Time slot at which data is transmitted by sender
  - User takes control of channel for fixed amount of time
  - Data is not transmitted simultaneously rather data transmitted one-by-one
  - Signal is transmitted in the form of frames 
  - Frame contain cycle of time slots in which each frame contain one or more slots dedicated to each user
  - Used to multiplex both digital and analog signals but mainly used to multiplex digital signals
  
  Synchronous TDM :-
   - Time slot is pre-assigned to every device irrespective of fact that device contain data or not.
   - If device not have data then slot remain empty
   - Signals sent in form of frames 
   - Time slots are organized in the form of frames
   - If device not have data for particular time slot then empty slot transmitted
   - Popular Synchronous TDM are T-1 multiplexing, ISDN multiplexing, and SONET multiplexing
   - If there are n device then there are n slots
 
   Disadvantages Of Synchronous TDM :
    - Capacity of channel is not fully utilized as empty slots also transmitted 
    - Speed of the transmission medium should be greater than total speed of input lines 
  

  Asynchronous / Statistical TDM :-
   - Time slots are not fixed 
   - Time slots allocated to only those devices which have data to send 
   - Transmit only data from active workstations
   - It dynamically allocates time slots to the devices
   - Total speed of input lines greater than capacity of channel
   - Accept incoming data stream and create frame that contain only data with no empty slots
   - Each slot contain address part that identifies source of data
    
   Diagram :- [Address | Data]

   - Difference is that many slots in Synchronous TDM are unutilized but in Asynchronous TDM fully slots utilized 
   - This leads to smaller transmission time and efficient utilization of capacity of the channel.
   - In Synchronous TDM if n sending devices then there are n time slots 
   - In Asynchronous TDM, if there are n sending devices then there are m time slots where m is less than n (m<n)
   - Number of slots in frame depends on statistical analysis of number of input lines




Switching :-
When a user accesses the internet or another computer network outside their immediate location, messages are sent through the network of transmission media. This technique of transferring the information from one computer network to another network is known as switching.
Switching in a computer network is achieved by using switches. A switch is a small hardware device which is used to join multiple computers together with one local area network (LAN).
Network switches operate at layer 2 (Data link layer) in the OSI model.
Switching is transparent to the user and does not require any configuration in the home network.
Switches are used to forward the packets based on MAC addresses.
A Switch is used to transfer the data only to the device that has been addressed. It verifies the destination address to route the packet appropriately.
It is operated in full duplex mode.
Packet collision is minimum as it directly communicates between source and destination.
It does not broadcast the message as it works with limited bandwidth.


Why is Switching Concept required?
Switching concept is developed because of the following reasons:

Bandwidth: It is defined as the maximum transfer rate of a cable. It is a very critical and expensive resource. Therefore, switching techniques are used for the effective utilization of the bandwidth of a network.
Collision: Collision is the effect that occurs when more than one device transmits the message over the same physical media, and they collide with each other. To overcome this problem, switching technology is implemented so that packets do not collide with each other.
Advantages of Switching:
Switch increases the bandwidth of the network.
It reduces the workload on individual PCs as it sends the information to only that device which has been addressed.
It increases the overall performance of the network by reducing the traffic on the network.
There will be less frame collision as switch creates the collision domain for each connection.
Disadvantages of Switching:
A Switch is more expensive than network bridges.
A Switch cannot determine the network connectivity issues easily.
Proper designing and configuration of the switch are required to handle multicast packets.
