Transmission mode :-
 - Transferring data between two devices also known as Communication mode
 - Buses and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected
 
 Types of transmission mode :-
 Simplex Mode :-
  - Communication is unidirectional 
  - Use entire capacity of channel to send data in one direction
  Example : Keyboard and traditional monitors 
  - Keyboard only introduce input and monitor only give output
 

 Half-Duplex Mode :-
  - Both transmit and receive but not at same time 
  - When one device is sending other can only receive and vice versa 
  - Used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at same time 
  - Entire capacity of channel utilized for each direction
  Example : In Walkie-talkie message sent one at time and messages are sent in both direction
  Channel capacity  = Bandwidth * Propagation Delay

 
 Full-Duplex Mode :-
  - Both transmit and receive simultaneously 
  - Signals going in one direction share capacity of link with signals going in another direction this sharing
    occur in two ways :- 
    - Either link must contain two physically separate transmission paths one for sending and other for receiving
    - Capacity is divided between signals traveling in both directions
  - Used when communication in both directions required all time 
  - Channel capacity must be divided between two directions
  Example :- Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by telephone line
  Channel Capacity  = 2 * Bandwidth * Propagation Delay




Signal Conversion :-
 Digital Signal : 
  - Represents data as sequence of discrete values at any given time it can only take on one of finite number of values

 Analog Signal :- 
  - Signal is any continuous signal for which time varying feature of signal is representation of some other time
    varying quantity i.e., analogous to another time varying signal


 Analog to Digital Signal :-
 
  Pulse Code Modulation(PCM):-
   - Change analog signal to digital data
   Process :- Sampling | Quantization | Encoding
   
   Low Pass Filter :-
    - Eliminates high frequency component present in input analog signal to ensure that input signal sampler is free
      from unwanted frequency components
    - This is done to avoid aliasing of message signal
   

   Sampling :-
    - Process of measuring amplitude of continuous-time signal at discrete instants
    - Converting continuous signal into discrete signal
    Idel Sampling    :- Known as Instantaneous sampling pulses from analog signal are sampled
    Natural Sampling :- 
     - Practical method of sampling in which pulse have finite width equal to T
     - Result is sequence of samples that retain shape of analog signal
    Flat Top Sampling :- Top of samples remains constant by using circuit

    Nyquist Theorem :-
     - Sampling rate must be at least 2 times highest frequency contained in signal 
     - Also known as minimum sampling rate and given by :- Fs = 2 * fh
   
   
   Quantization :-
    - Sampling is series of pulses with amplitude values between maximum and minimum amplitudes of signal 
    - Set of amplitudes infinite with non-integral values between two limits
    - D = (Vmax - Vmin) / L
    - Normalized pulse amplitude modulation(PAM) value is calculated using formula :- amplitude / d


   Encoding :-
    - Digitization of analog signal is done by encoder 
    - After each sample is quantized and number of bits per sample is decided each sample changed to n bit code 
    - Encoding also minimizes bandwidth used



  DELTA MODULATION :-
    - Find change from previous value
    Modulator :- 
     - Used at sender site to create stream of bits from analog signal 
     - Process records small positive change called delta 
     - If delta is positive process records a 1 else process records a 0 
     - It build second signal that resembles staircase 
     - Input signal is then compared with this gradually made staircase signal
     Rules :- 
      - Input analog signal higher than lastvalue of staircase signal increase delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 1
      - Input analog signal lower than lastvalue of staircase signal decrease delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 0



  ADAPTIVE DELTA MODULATION(ADM):-
    - Performance of delta modulator improved significantly by making step size of modulator assume time-varying form 
    - Larger step-size is needed where message has steep slope of modulating signal 
    - Smaller step-size is needed where message has small slope and Size is adapted according to level of input signal 
      these method knows as ADM    



 Digital to Analog conversion :-
  Amplitude Shift Keying :-
   - Carrier signal is analog and data to be modulated is digital 
   - Aanalog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data
   - Binary signal gives zero value when binary data represent 0 while gives carrier output when data is 1

Wireless Communication :- 
 - Data travel through air, there must be some constraints within which wireless communication takes place    
 - All wireless devices must follow a common standard i.e, IEEE 802.11
 - Wireless coverage must be there where devices are expected to use
 - Wired network under IEEE standard 802.3 while wireless network under IEEE standard 802.11
 - IEEE stands for "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers" is an organization composed of engineers 
   that issues and manages standards for electrical and electronic devices


 Basic of Wireless Communication :-
  - Takes places through RF(radio frequency) one device Transmitter send signal to other device Receiver 
  - Two devices (transmitter and receiver) must use same frequency (or channel) to be able to communicate 
  - If large number of wireless devices communicate at same time radio frequency cause interference with each other
  - Interference increases as no of devices increases
  - All wireless devices operate in half duplex mode to avoid collision or interference
  - To achieve full duplex mode, devices uses different frequency or channel of transmission and receiving of signal
  - wireless communication is Full-duplex but technically it is not



 Radio Frequency :-
  - Sender(transmitter) send alternating current into section of wire(antenna) 
  - This sets up moving electric and magnetic field that away as travelling waves 
  - Electric and magnetic field moves along each other at right angle to each other 
  - Signal must keep changing or alternating by cycle up and down to keep electric and magnetic field cyclic and 
    pushing forward 
  - No of cycles wave taking in second is called Frequency of wave
  So :- frequency = no of cycles per second  
  - Electromagnetic waves not travel in straight line 
  - They travel by expanding in all direction away from antenna
  
  Unit	    Abbreviation	Meaning
   Hertz	    Hz        	Cycles per second
   Kilohertz	KHz	        1000 Hz
   Megahertz	MHz	        1,000,000 Hz
   Gigahertz	GHz	        1,000,000,000 Hz



 Basic Service Set(BSS):-
  - To regulate connection to devices, make every wireless service area closed group of mobile devices that form
    around fixed device
  - IEEE calls this standard BSS
  - At center of every BSS there is access point (AP), it Provide services that are necessary to form infrastructure 
    of Wireless communication 
  - AP operates in infrastructure mode and uses single wireless channel 
  - All devices that want to connect to AP must use that same channel
  - Because operation of BSS depends on AP BSS is bounded to area covered by AP 
  - Area up to which AP’s signal is reachable, This area is called Basic Service Area (BSA) or cell 
  - Cell is usually circular shape with center as AP 
  - AP serves as single point of contact for BSS 
  - AP use unique BSS identifier(BSSID) based on its own MAC address to advertise it’s existence to all devices in cell
  - AP also advertises human-readable text string called Service Set identifier(SSID) to uniquely identify AP 
  - BSSID as machine-readable unique tag to identify wireless service and SSID human-readable service tag
  - Membership of mobile devices with BSS is called Association 
  - Once associated device becomes BSS client or 802.11 station (STA) 
  - As long as devices connected to AP all data communication passes through AP using BSSID as source and destination
    address 
  - You can think why all traffic must pass through AP? 
  - They simply communicate with other devices directly without AP as middleman
  - If we don’t do so then whole point of wireless service will go in vain 
  - Sending data through AP make it stable and controllable



 Repeater :-
  - AP in wireless infrastructure usually connected back to switched networks 
  - BSS has limited signal coverage area(BSA) 
  - To extend signal coverage add additional AP but in some scenarios not possible, Solution is Repeater
  - Repeater is just AP configured in Repeater mode 
  - Wireless repeater takes signal as input and retransmits signals in new cell around Repeater 
  - Repeater uses two transmitters and receiver to keep original and repeated signals isolated on different channel
