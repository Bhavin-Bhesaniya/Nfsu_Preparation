   - 10 means 10 MBPS(Mega Bit Per Second) data can be transfer per second
   Base has two types :-
    BaseBrand :- Only one signal transmit at time if other signal come collision arise(Dedicated cable bandwidth)
    BroadBand :- Multiple signal parallel transmit and cable bandwidth split into separate ranges
   - T means only 100 meter signal can be transmit than attuention occurs(Signal strength week)

  Question :- If N devices connect on network, what is maximum collision domain ? --> N
  


 Repeater :-
  - Works on 2 port physical layer device 
  - Regenerate signal strength over same network before signal become too weak or corrupted 
  - Forwarding signal but not supporting filtering and maximum collision is N
  - It not amplify signal means it regenerate signal again rather than Increase it strength to 2X or 4X like Amplifier
  


 Hub :-
  - Multi-Point Repeater Hardware device
  - Support forwarding but not supporting filtering so high traffic become collision domain problem
  - Not have intelligence to find out best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage

  Active Hub :- 
   - Own power supply, clean, boost and relay signal along with network 
   - Serve both as repeater as well as wiring center 
   - Extend maximum distance between nodes

  Passive Hub :-

   - Support forwarding and learning
   
  Source Routing Bridges :- 
   - Routing operation performed by source station and frame specifies which route to follow 
   - Host discover frame by sending special frame called discovery frame, which spread through entire network
     using all possible path to destination



 Switch :-

 Router :-
  - Designed to receive, analyze and forward data packet between two different network(Network Layer device)(LAN -> WAN)
  - Check destination IP address that given in data packet header for forwarding packet
  - Routing tables decide best path to transfer packet with Use of ICMP protocol for messageing
  - Virtual router use Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol(VRRP) to Increase network Realibility by configuring as 
    default gateway and it run on server
  - Router more capable than other network Device
  Benefits :- Security | Performance Enhancement | Realibility | Networking Range

  How works?
   - Analyze destination IP address(Given in packet header) --> Compare with routing table --> 
     Transfer particular direction(Set of rules compute best path for route)
   - Use cabel or DSL model to allow communication
   - It has port to connect different device on internet at same time
   - Routing table determine where data come from and where to send

  - But even Switches cannot divide network into separate Broadcast domain
  - VLAN divide single Broadcast domain into multiple Broadcast domain 
  - Host in one VLAN cannot speak to host in another 
  - By default, all hosts placed into same VLAN
