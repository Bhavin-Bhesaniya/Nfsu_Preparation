  Question :- 
    If N devices connect on network, what is maximum collision domain ? --> N
    Cable can filter or not :- 
      - If Two Lan connected it can move signal or not
      - Filter means can we decied it can move further or not
    Ans :- Yes, there is no software in cabel



 Repeater :-
  - Works on 2 port physical layer device 
  - Regenerate signal strength over same network before signal become too weak or corrupted 
  - Forwarding signal but not supporting filtering and maximum collision is N
  - It not amplify signal means it regenerate signal again rather than Increase it strength to 2X or 4X like Amplifier
  


 Hub :-
  - Multi-Point Repeater Hardware device
  - Support forwarding but not supporting filtering so high traffic which become collision domain problem
  - Not have intelligence to find out best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage

      reconfiguration of stations is unnecessary 
    - These bridges make use of two processes forwarding and learning
   
   Source Routing Bridges :- 
    - Routing operation is performed by source station and frame specifies which route to follow 
    - Host can discover frame by sending special frame called discovery frame, which spread through entire network
      using all possible paths to destination



 Switches :-
  - Multi-Port Bridges with buffer and its design boost its efficiency(No ports imply less traffic) and performance
  - Data-Link Layer device
  - Full Duplex Link
  - Perform error checking before forwarding data and correct port only so Traffic is minimal

 Router :-
  - Physical or virtual internetworking device that designed to receive, analyze and forward data packet between 
    two different network/ router (Network Layer device)(Connect two different network Like LAN -> WAN )
  - Check destination IP address given in data packet header for forwarding packet
  - Routing tables decide best path to transfer packet
  - Use ICMP protocol to communicate between two or more network
  - Virtual router use virtual router redundancy protocol to Increase network Realibility which is done by configuring
    as default gateway and it run on server
  - Router is more capable than other network Device

  How works?
   - Analyze destination IP address(Given in packet header) --> Compare with routing table --> Transfer particular
     direction(Set of rules compute best path for route)
   - Router use modem such as cabel  or DSL model to allow communication
   - Router has port to connect different device to internet at same time
   - Routing table determine where data come from and where to send 

  Types of routing table :- Static(manually configure)  |  Dynamic (Based on network activity)
