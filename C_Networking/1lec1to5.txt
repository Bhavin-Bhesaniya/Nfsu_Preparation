Need Of OSI(Open System Interconnection) :-
 - Device can share data with other devices
 - To send data to other device required connection so that data, packets will move from sender to receiver machine
 - If client and server on same machine, will managed by OS (Inter-Process Communication)
 - So in Computer network must be client and server both machine required physically separated

 Functionality :-
  Mandatory :-
   Error Control - Receiver receive same message or not
   Flow Control  - Amount of data we send
   Multiplexing / Demultiplexing :- Process that run on machine identify which process send data or receive data

  2)Optional :-
   Encryption | Decryption | Cryptographic
   CheckPoint :- Downloading data at some point of time we need to add check point (Resume Downloading)

 - OSI model provid standard for sending and receiving message using network functionality
 - OSI model divided into 7 layers :-
   Physical  -->  Data Link  -->  Network  -->  Transport  -->  Session  -->  Presentation  -->  Application

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol) and OSI Vs TCP/IP :-
 - Developed by ARPANET funded by DARPA
 - Support Client-Server and peer-to-peer communication
 - OSI developed by ISO

 Difference Architecture of TCP/IP and OSI :-
  Application     Application  Application             Process to Process
  Presentation       
  Session                 
  Transport       Transport    Transport               Host to Host
  Network         Network      Internet                Source to destination
  Data Link       Data Link    Network                 Node to Node
                               Access
  Physical        Physical     Layer

  7 Layer(OSI)    5 Layer(TCP/IP) 4 Layer(TCP/IP)
