lec-2 : Need Of OSI(Open System Interconnection)
 - Device can share data with other devices
 - To send data to other need some kind of connection through packets, data will move from sender to receiver machine
 - If client and server on same machine it will be managed by OS (Inter-Process Communication)
 - So Computer network there must be client and server both machine required physically separated

 Functionality :-
  1)Mandatory :-
   Error Control - Receiver receive same message or not
   Flow Control  - Amount of data we send
   Multiplexing / Demultiplexing :- Lots of process run on machine in which identify which process send data or receive data

  2)Optional :-
   Encryption | Decryption | Cryptographic
   CheckPoint :- Downloading data at some point of time we need to add check point (Resume Downloading)

 - OSI model provided standard for sending message and receiving message using network functionality
 - OSI model divided into 7 layers :-
    Physical     -->     Data Link    -->    Network     -->     Transport   -->     Session     -->     Presentation  -->  Application



lec-3 : TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol) and OSI Vs TCP/IP :-
 - Developed by ARPANET funded by DARPA
 - Support Client-Server and peer-to-peer communication
 - OSI developed by ISO
 Difference Architecture of TCP/IP and OSI :-

    Application     Application Layer       Application             Process to Process
    Layer           Presentation Layer      Layer
                    Session Layer                
    Transport       Transport               Transport               Host to Host
    Network         Network                 Internet                Source to destination
    Data Link       Data Link               Network                 Node to Node
                                            Access
    Physical        Physical                Layer
