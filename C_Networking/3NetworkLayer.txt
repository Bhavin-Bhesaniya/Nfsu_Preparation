Introduction to Network Layer(Layer-3) :-
 - Translate logical addresses into physical addresses
 - It determine route from source to destination and manage traffic problem such as switching, routing and 
   control congestion of data packet
  
  Function :-
   Routing          :- Move packet from Sending host router's input link to another router's output link 
   Internetworking  :- Provide logical connection between different types of networks
   Fragmentation    :- Breaking packet into smallest individual data unit that travel through different network
   Logical Addressing :-  Add logical addresses of both sender and receiver into packet header

   Forwarding & Routing :- 
    - Every router has forwarding table 
    - Router forward packet by examining packet's header field then using it value to index into forwarding table 
    - Value store in forwarding table corresponding to header field value indicate router's outgoing interface link
      to which packet forwarded
    - Routing algorithm can be centralized or decentralized

    Diagram :- Forwarding Table
      HeaderValue  OutputLink
        0100        3
        0101        2
        0100        2
        1111        1


  Services :- 
   Guaranteed delivery   :- Guarantees that packet receive to receiver
   with bounded delay    :- Packet delivered within specified host-to-host delay bound
   In-Order packets      :- Packet arrives at destination in the order in which they are sent
   Guaranteed max jitter :- Time taken between two transmission at sender equal to time taken receipt at destination
   
   Security services :- 
    - Security using session key between source and destination host 
    - Source host encrypt payload of data being sent to destination host 
    - Destination host then decrypt payload 
    - Maintain data integrity and source authentication service



Network Addressing :-
 - Network addresses are always logical, i.e., software-based addresses.
 - Boundary between host and link is known as interface Therefore host have only one interface
 - Router is different from host in that it has two or more links that connect to it 
 - When router forward datagram then it forward packet to one of the links 
 - Each interface capable of sending and receiving IP packet so IP require each interface have address
 - Each IP address 32-bit long represented in form of "dot-decimal notation" where each byte written in decimal form
 - IP address would look like 193.32.216.9 where 193 represent decimal notation of first 8 bits of address
 - First three byte in IP address specifies network and last byte of IP address specifies host in network


 Classful Addressing :-
  IP address divided into sub-classes : Class A  |  Class B  |  Class C  |  Class D  |  Class E
  Ip address  divided into two part :- Network ID : Represent number of network | Host ID : Represent number of host

  Diagram :- 
                Byte-1      Byte-2      Byte-3      Byte-4     (8-bit)
    Class A     NET ID      <---------- Host ID ---------->  
    Class B     <---- NET ID ---->      <---- Host ID ---->
    Class C     <---------- NET ID ---------->      Host ID  
    Class D     <----------- MultiCast Address ----------->
    Class E     <---------------- RESERVED --------------->

  Rules for assigning Host ID :
   - Used to determine host within network 
   - Host ID must be unique 
   - All bits set to 0 cannot be assigned as it represent network ID of IP address
   - All bits set to 1 cannot be assigned as it is reserved for multicast address


  Rules for assigning Network ID :
   - If host located within same local network then assigned with same network ID 
   - Cannot start with 127 as 127 is used by Class A
   - All bit set to 0 cannot be assigned as it specify particular host on local network
   - All bits set to 1 cannot be assigned as it is reserved for multicast address
  


  Class A :-
   - IP address assigned to those network that contain large number of host
   - NET ID 8 bit and host ID 24 bits long
   - First bit in higher order bits of first octet is always set to 0 and remaining 7 bit determine network ID 
   - 24 bit determine host ID in any network
   - Total number of network in Class A = 2^7 = 128 network address
   - Total number of hosts in   Class A = 2^24 - 2 = 16,777,214 host address

Routing :-
 - Process of forward packet based on information in packet header and forwarding table 
 - Router work at network layer in OSI model and internet layer in TCP/IP model 
 - Routing algorithm software responsible for deciding optimal path for packet transfer
 - Routing protocol use metric to determine best path for packet delivery 
 
 Routing Metric :-
  - Metric is network variable used for standard measurement such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, current load on path
  - Some routing protocols use dynamic metrics means that their value assigned by system administrator

  Hop count :- Protocol consist hop as primary metric value then path with least hop count considered best to move
  Delay     :- Time taken by router to process, queue and transmit datagram to interface 
  
  Bandwidth :- 
    - Capacity of link known as Bandwidth measured in terms of bits per second
    - Link that has higher transfer rate like gigabit is preferred over lower capacity
    - Higher bandwidth considered best route

  Load :- 
    - Calculated network resource such as CPU utilization, packets processed per second 
    - If traffic increases then load value also increased and changes with respect to change in traffic

  Reliability :- 
   - Composed of fixed value that depend on network link and its value measured dynamically 
   - Some network go down more often than other
   - After network failure some network link repaired more easily than other network link
   - Factor for Reliability that numeric value assigned by system administrator


 Types of Routing :- 

  Static Routing (Nonadaptive Routing) :-
   - Administrator manually add route in routing table to send packet based on table
   - Routing decision not made by condition or topology of network
   - No Overhead(Cpu usage) | Not Bandwidth | Security Administrator 
   - Very difficult for large network | Administrator good knowledge of topology required 


  Default Routing :-
   - Router send all packet to same hop device and it doesn't matter whether it belong to particular network or not
   - Used when network deal with single exit point(Same device)
   - When specific route mentioned in routing table router will choose specific route rather than default route
   - Default route is chossen only when specific route not mentioned in routing table

  
  Dynamic Routing(Adaptive Routing):-
   - Router add new route in routing table for each packet in response to change in condition or topology of network
   - Dynamic protocol RIP and OSPF used to discover new routes
   - If any route goes down then automatic adjustment made to reach destination
   - All router must have same dynamic routing protocol in order to exchange route
   - If router discover any change in topology condition then router broadcast information to all other router
   - Easier to configure | More effective in selecting best route
   - More expensive in terms of CPU and bandwidth usage | Less secure
   


Routing algorithm :-
 Adaptive Routing algorithm(Dynamic routing algorithm)(Complex) :-
  - Parameters used are hop count, distance and estimated transit time
  
  Centralized algorithm(Global routing algorithm) :- 
   - Compute least-cost path between source and destination by using knowledge about network(Network Cost)
   - Link state algorithm referred as centralized algorithm since it aware of cost of each link in network
   
  Isolation algorithm :- 
   - Obtain routing information by using local information rather than gathering information from other node

  Distributed algorithm :- 
   - Compute least-cost path between source and destination in iterative and distributed manner 
   - Beginning node contain information only about its own directly attached link and through iterative process of
     calculation compute least-cost path to destination 
   - Decentralized algorithm as never know complete path from source to destination instead it knows direction through
     which packet is to be forwarded along with least cost path
  

 Non-Adaptive Routing algorithm(Static routing algorithm)(Simple)  :-
  - When booting up network routing information store to router
  - Not take routing decision based on network topology or network traffic instead of using static table 
  
  Flooding :- 
   - Every incoming packet sent to all outgoing links
   Disadvantage :- Node contain several copies of particular packet

  Random walks :- 
   - Packet sent by node to one of its neighbors randomly 
   Advantage :- Uses alternative routes very efficiently
 


Network Layer Protocol :-
 
 ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) :-
  - Associate IP address with MAC address
  - Each device on network recognized by MAC address imprinted on NIC 
  - MAC address can be changed easily but IP address does not change 
  - ARP used to find MAC address of node when internet address is known
  Note :-  
   MAC address : Used to identify actual device 
   IP address  : Address used to locate device on network

  
  How ARP works :-
   - If host wants to know physical address of another host on its network then it send ARP query packet(ARP cache) 
     that include IP address or not otherwise broadcast it over network 
   - Every host on network receives and processes ARP packet but only intended recipient recognizes IP address and send
     response back physical address
   - Host holding datagram add physical address to cache memory and to datagram header then sends back to sender
   - Once MAC address received by device then communication take place between two device
   Note: ARP cache is used to make a network more efficient.

  
  Types of ARP entries :
   Dynamic entry :- Automatically created when sender broadcast its message to entire network (not permanent and remove)
   Static entry  :- Where someone manually enter IP to MAC address association by using ARP command utility.


 RARP(Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) :-
  - Obtain IP address from server
  - Host need IP address then broadcast RARP query packet that contain its physical address to entire network
  - RARP server on network recognizes RARP packet and respond back with host IP address
  - Message format similar to ARP protocol
  - Like ARP frame, RARP frame is sent from one machine to another in encapsulated data


 ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) :-
  - Used by host and router to send notification of IP datagram problem back to sender
  - ICMP uses echo test/reply to check whether destination is reachable and responding
  - ICMP handles both control and error messages but it report error to sender not to correct them
  - IP datagram contain address of both source and destination but not know address of previous router through which
    it passed, Due to this reason ICMP only send messages to source but not to immediate routers
  - ICMP messages are transmitted within IP datagram

  Diagram :-  [ IP header | ICMP Message ]

  Format :- ICMP Message
    0       7   8       15  16      31  
    8-bit type  8-bit code  16-bit Checksum
   
   - First field specifies message type
   - Second Reason for particular message type
   - Checksum field cover entire ICMP message

  
  Error Reporting :-
   - ICMP protocol reports the error messages to the sender.
   Types of error handle :- Destination unreachable | Source Quench | Time Exceeded | Parameter problem | Redirection

   Destination unreachable :
    - Sent from receiver to sender when destination cannot be reached or discard destination not reachable
   
   Source Quench :- 
    - Congestion control, message sent from congested router to source host to reduce transmission rate 
    - ICMP take IP of discarded packet and then add source quench message to IP datagram to inform source host to 
      reduce its transmission rate 
    - Source host will reduce transmission rate so that router will free from congestion

   Time Exceeded / Time-To-Live :- 
    - Parameter that define how long packet should live before it would be discarded
    - Sometime packet discarded due to bad routing implementation and this causes looping issue and network congestion
    - Due to looping issue value of TTL keeps on decrementing and when it reaches zero router discard datagram 
    - However when datagram discarded by router time exceeded message sent by router to source host
    - When destination host not receive all fragments in certain time limit then received fragment also discarded 
      and destination host send time Exceeded message to source host
    Types :-
    Parameter problem :- 
     - When router or host discover any missing value in IP datagram, router discard datagram and "parameter problem" 
       message sent back to source host
    
    Redirection :- 
     - Message generated when host consist of small routing table 
     - When host consist of limited number of entries due to which it send datagram to wrong router
     - Router that receive datagram will forward datagram to correct router and also send "Redirection message" to 
       host to update its routing table


 IGMP(Internet Group Message Protocol) :-
  - IGMP used by hosts and router to support multicasting and identify host in LAN that are members of group
  Support two type communication : Unicasting  | Multicasting
  Unicasting   :- Communication between one sender and one receiver (one-to-one)
  Multicasting :- Sometime sender want to send same message to large number of receivers simultaneously(one-to-many)

  - IGMP part of IP layer and has fixed-size message
  - IGMP message encapsulated within IP datagram

  Diagram :-  
    IP Header  |  IGMP Message
    20 byte       8 Byte
  
  Format of IGMP message :-
    Type   |  Maximum Response Time  |  Checksum
    8-bit  |  8-bits                 |  8-bit | 8-bit 

   Type : Type of IGMP message, three types of IGMP message : Membership Query, Membership Report and Leave Report
    Group Address : Behavior of this field depend on type of message sent 
      Membership Query :- Group address set zero for General Query and set to multicast for specific query
      Membership Report:- Group address is set to multicast group address
      Leave Group :- Set to multicast group address

   Maximum Response Time :- 
    - Used Only by Membership Query message 
    - It determine maximum time host can send Membership Report message in response to Membership Query message
   
   Checksum :- Determine entire payload of IP datagram in which IGMP message encapsulated



Distance Vector Routing Algorithm(Dynamic Algorithm) :-
 - Each router maintain distance table known as Vector that used in ARPANET and RIP
 Iterative    : Process continue until no more information available to be exchanged between neighbors
 Distributed  : Each node receive information from one or more of its directly attached neighbors perform calculation 
                and then distribute result back to its neighbor
 Asynchronous : All of its nodes operate in lock step with each other
 
 Keys to understand working of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm :-
  Knowledge about whole network | Routing only to neighbors | Information sharing at regular intervals(Within 30 second)

 Least cost related by Bellman-Ford equation :- dx(y) = minv{c(x,v) + dv(y)}
 
 

Sharing Information :-
 - Distance vector routing algorithm simplifie routing process by assuming cost of every link is one unit 
 - Therefore efficiency of transmission measured by number of links to reach destination
 - Cost is based on hop count
 - Routers get its own information plus new information about neighbor


 Routing Table :- Creating Table  |  Updating Table
  Creating Table :-
   - Created for each router that contain atleast three types of information such Network ID, cost and next hop
   - These routing table sent to all neighbours
   NET ID   : Network ID define final destination of packet
   Cost     : Number of hops that packet take to get there
   Next hop : Router to which packet must be delivered

   For Example :
    A send its routing table to B, F & E. 
    B send its routing table to A & C  
    C send its routing table to B & D
  

  Updating Table :-
   - When A receive routing table from B then it use its information to update table
   - Combined table may contain some duplicate data 
   - Every router receive information from neighbor and update routing table



Link State Routing(Dijkstra's algorithm):-
 Knowledge about neighborhood : 
   - Instead of sending its routing table, router sends information about its neighborhood only 
   - Router broadcast its identities and cost of directly attached links to other router
 Flooding : Router send information to every other router except its neighbor
 Information sharing : Router send information to every other router only when change occurs in information

 Reliable Flooding :- Initial state : Each node know cost of its neighbors | Final state : Each node know entire graph

 Route Calculation :-
  - Dijkstra's algorithm is iterative and it has property that after kth iteration of algorithm, least cost path are
     well known for k destination nodes
   c(i, j) : Link cost from node i to node j, If i and j node not directly linked, then c(i, j) = ∞
   D(v) : Define cost of path from source code to destination v that has least cost currently
   P(v) : Define previous node(Neighbor of v) along with current least cost path from source to v
   N    : Total number of nodes available in network

  Disadvantage :- Heavy traffic created in Line state routing due to Flooding(Infinite lopping) (Slove Time-to-leave)
