Introduction to Physical Layer(Layer-1) :-
 - Last layer from sender side and top layer in receiver side deal with hardware
 - Store information in form of bits and Convert it into signal for transmission using guided-unguided media
 
 Functionality :-
  Cabels and Connectors    - Twisted, Co-axial, Optical Fibers used to send data on signal 
                           - BNC, MGRT, UTP Connector(Join Cabel)
  Physical Topology        -  Connect Pysical device and Configuration it (Star, Mesh, Bus, Tree, Ring, Point-To-Point) 
  Hardware(Repeater, Hub)  - Increase signal strength | Hub for multipoint connection
  Transmission mode        - Simplex-mode, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex
  Encoding                 - Send data into analog or digital signal
  Multiplexing/ Demultiplexing - 
   - If machine increase on same Channel not need to create new channel use existing channel using time division 
   - Send N number of signal in single signal known as Multiplexing
   - Convert single signal to N no. of signal known as demultiplexing



Transmission mode :- 

 Simplex Mode :-
  - Communication is unidirectional 
  - Single Device at same time only send data but cannot receive
  - Use entire capacity of channel to send data in one direction so more data transmitted
  Example : Keyboard and Monitors | Radio 
 

 Half-Duplex Mode :-
  - Both Device transmit and receive data but not at same time 
  - Entire capacity of channel utilized for each direction at time
  - It possible to perform error detection
  Channel capacity = Bandwidth * Propagation Delay
  Example : In Walkie-talkie message sent one at time and messages are sent in both direction

 
 Full-Duplex Mode :-
  - Bi-directional where Both device transmit and receive data simultaneously 
  - Channel capacity must divided between two direction
  - Link contain two physically separate transmission path one for sending and other for receiving
  Channel Capacity  = 2 * Bandwidth * Propagation Delay
  Example :- Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by telephone line



Digital Transmission / Signal Conversion :- 
 - To send data over network must convert into signal 
 - Signal either digital or analog form
 
 Digital Signal :- Represent data as sequence of discrete value

 Analog Signal :- 
  - Signal is any continuous signal for which time varying feature of signal is representation of some other time
    varying quantity

 
 Digital-to-Digital :-
  - Digital to Digital conversion involves three techniques – Line Coding, Block Coding, and Scrambling 
  
  Line Coding :- 
   - Self-synchronizing both receiver and sender clock
   - Error-detecting capability and less complexity
  
  Scrambling  :- Not increase number of bits and provide synchronization 
  
     
 

  Types of Digital-to-Digital encoding :-
  Unipolar :-
   - Non Return to Zero(NRZ) positive voltage defines bit 1 and zero voltage defines bit 0
   - Signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit thus it is called NRZ
   - Uses more power as compared to polar scheme to send one bit per unit line resistance
   - Polarity assigned to 1 binary state
   Problem :- DC Component  |  Synchronization


  Polar :-
   - Uses two voltage levels :- one positive and another is negative
   - By using two voltage level average voltage level reduced and DC component problem is alleviated   
   Types :- NRZ (NRZ-L)(NRZ-I)  |  RZ  |  BIPHASE(Manchester)(Different Manchester) 


   NRZ(Non-Return Zero):-
    - level of signal represented either positive or negative    
    NRZ-L :- Level of signal depend on type of bit that it represent Either 0(Positive) and 1(Negative)
    NRZ-I :- Inversion of voltage level that represent in bit, 0 no change and 1 bit represent change voltage level


   RZ(Return to Zero) :- 
    - Use three values positive, negative and zero for signal change of each bit to achieve synchronization
    - 1 bit is represented by positive-to-zero and 0 bit is represented by negative-to-zero  

   
   BIPHASE(Manchester and differential manchester encoding) :- 
    - Transmission of data means convert upper layer digital data(0,1 form) to analog or digital signal
    - To encode data digital to digital we use manchester and differential manchester encoding
    - Dr.thomas and IEEE802.3 convention
    
    Manchester :-
      0 -->  -|_
      1 -->  _|-

    Different Manchester Encoding :-
      0 --> |-|_ , |_|- 
      1 --> -|_  , _|-

  
  Bipolar :- AMI and Pseudoternary  |  Ultilevel  |  Multitransition
   - Represent three voltage levels: positive, negative, and zero 
   - Binary 0 represent Zero level and 1 represented by alternating positive and negative voltage
   - If first 1 bit represented by positive amplitude then second 1 bit represented by negative voltage 
     third 1 bit by positive amplitude and so on
   Types :- AMI  |  B8ZS  |  HDB3

   AMI(Alternative Mark Inversion) :- 
    - Mark work comes from telegraphy which means 1 So it redefined as alternate 1 inversion
    - 0 bit represented by zero level and 1 bit represented by alternating positive and negative voltages
    - DC Component Zero  |  Sequence of 1s bits are synchronized
    - Not ensure synchronization of long string of 0s bits
   

   B8ZS(Bipolar with 8-zero substitution) :-
    - Similar to AMI except when eight consecutive zero-level voltage encountered they replaced by sequence "000VB0VB"
    - V(Violation) is non-zero voltage which means signal have same polarity as previous non-zero voltage
    - B(Bipolar) also non-zero voltage level which is accordance with AMI rule

      is free from unwanted frequency component
    - Avoid aliasing of message signal
   

   Sampling :-
    - Converting continuous signal into discrete signal
    Type :- Idel | Natural | Flat-Top
    
    Nyquist Theorem :-
     - Sampling rate must be at least 2 times highest frequency contained in signal 
     - Also known as minimum sampling rate and given by :- Fs = 2 * fh
   
   
   Quantization :-
    - Process of assigning integral values in specific range to sampled instances
    - D = (Vmax - Vmin) / L
    - Normalized pulse amplitude modulation(PAM) value is calculated using formula :- amplitude / d


   Encoding :- Digitization of analog signal is done by encoder but it also minimize bandwidth used


  DELTA MODULATION :-
   - Find change from previous value
   Modulator :- 
    - Used at sender side to create stream of bits from analog signal 
    - Process record small positive change called delta 
    - If delta is positive process records a 1 else process records a 0 
    - It build second signal that resembles staircase 
    - Input signal is then compared with this gradually made staircase signal
    Rules :- 
     - Input analog signal higher than lastvalue of staircase signal increase delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 1
     - Input analog signal lower than lastvalue of staircase signal decrease delta by 1 and bit in digital data is 0


  ADAPTIVE DELTA MODULATION(ADM):-
   - Performance of delta modulator improved significantly by making step size of modulator assume time-varying form 
   - Larger step-size is needed where message has steep slope of modulating signal 
   - Smaller step-size is needed where message has small slope and Size is adapted according to level of input signal 
     these method knows as ADM    



 Digital to Analog conversion :-
  Amplitude Shift Keying :-
   - Carrier signal is analog and data to be modulated is digital 
   - Aanalog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data
   - Binary signal gives zero value when binary data represent 0 while gives carrier output when data is 1 
   - Frequency and phase of carrier signal remain constant

   Basic Service Set(BSS):-
    - To regulate connection to device, make every wireless service area closed group of mobile devices that form
      around fixed device IEEE calls this standard BSS
    - AP(Access Point) serves single point of contact for BSS 
    - AP use unique BSS identifier(BSSID) on its own MAC address to advertise it’s existence to all devices in cell
    - Also advertises human-readable text string called Service Set Identifier(SSID) to uniquely identify AP 
    - Membership of mobile device with BSS is called Association 
    - Once associated device become BSS client or 802.11 station (STA) 
    - As long device connect to AP all data communication pass through AP using BSSID as source and destination address 
    
  
   Repeater :-
    - AP in wireless infrastructure usually connected back to switched network 
    - Repeater is just AP configured in Repeater mode 
    - Wireless repeater takes signal as input and retransmit signals in new cell around Repeater 
    - Repeater use two transmitters and receiver to keep original and repeated signals isolated on different channel

 
 
Multiplexing / Demultiplexing :-
 - Process of combining multiple data stream over single medium known as multiplexing and hardware used for
   multiplexing known as multiplexer
 - Multiplexer(MUX) combine N input lines to generate single output line(Many-to-one) 
 - Receiver Separate receive signal into its component signals(one-to-many) Achieved using Demultiplexer(DEMUX) 
 - Multiplexing used in telecommunications in which several telephone calls carried through single wire
 - George Owen Squier developed telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910
   
 Why Multiplexing?
  - Only one signal transfer from sender to receiver at time in transmission medium  
  - When multiple signals share common medium there is possibility of collision to avoid it Multiplexing use
  - Medium bandwidth utilized effectively

 
 Frequency-division Multiplexing (FDM) :-
  - Divide available bandwidth into different frequency channel and allocate it to different device
  - Carrier which used for modulating signals are known as sub-carriers and represented as f1,f2..fn
  - Mainly used in radio broadcasts and TV networks

  Advantages :-
   - Used for analog signal | Simple and easy modulation | Large no. of signal sent simultaneously 
   - Not require synchronization between sender and receiver

  Disadvantages :-
   - Used only for low-speed channel | Suffer problem of crosstalk | Large number of modulators required
   - Require high bandwidth channel
 
 
 Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) :-
  - Same as FDM except that optical signals are transmitted through fibre optic cable to increase it capacity
  - Multiplexing and Demultiplexing achieved by using prism
  - Prism Combining various optical signal into form composite signal and transmitted it 
  

 Time Division Multiplexing(TDM) :-
  - All signal operate at same frequency with different time
  - Total time available in channel distributed among different user
  - User takes control of channel for fixed amount of time
  - Data not transmitted simultaneously rather data transmitted one-by-one
  - Signal is transmitted in the form of frames 
  - Frame contain cycle of time slot in which each frame contain one or more slot dedicated to each user
  - Used to multiplex both digital and analog signals but mainly used to multiplex digital signals
  
  Synchronous TDM :-
   - Time slot is pre-assigned to every device irrespective of fact that device contain data or not
   - If device not have data then slot remain empty then empty slot transmitted
   - Popular Synchronous TDM are T-1 multiplexing, ISDN multiplexing, and SONET multiplexing
 
   Disadvantages Of Synchronous TDM :
    - Channel Capacity not fully utilized as empty slot also transmitted 
    - Speed of transmission medium should be greater than total speed of input lines 
  

  Asynchronous / Statistical TDM :-
   - Time slots are not fixed and allocated to those device which have data to send 
   - Transmit only data from active workstation
   - It dynamically allocate time slot to device
   - Total speed of input line greater than capacity of channel
   - Accept incoming data stream and create frame that contain only data with no empty slot
   - Each slot contain address part that identifie data source
    
   Diagram :- [ Address | Data ]

   - Difference is that many slots in Synchronous TDM are unutilized but in Asynchronous TDM fully slots utilized 
   - Number of slots in frame depend on statistical analysis of number of input lines



Switching :-
 - Small hardware device which join multiple computers together with one local area network(LAN)
 - Switches forward packets based on MAC addresses to route packet appropriately
 - Operated in full duplex mode
 - Packet collision is minimum as it directly communicate between source and destination
 - It does not broadcast message as it works with limited bandwidth
 - Increases bandwidth and performance of network by reducing traffic | Less frame collision 
 - More expensive than bridges | Cannot determine connectivity issues easily | Proper configuration required 
 
 Why Switching Concept required?
  Bandwidth : Maximum transfer rate of cable | Critical and expensive resource |
  Collision : When more than one device transmit message over same physical media and they collide with each other 


 Switching Modes :-   
  Store-and-forward :-
   - Intermediate node store received frame then check for errors before forwarding packet to next node
   - On receiving entire frame, switch store frame into switch buffer memory known as process of storing frame
   - After frame stored check If error found message otherwise discarded message and forward to next node
   - CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check) uses number of bits to check for errors on received frame


  Cut-through Switching :-
   - Forward packet after destination address identified without waiting for entire frame to be received
   - Once frame received check first six bytes of frame then forward frame to destination
   - Low wait time/latency rate as it forward packes as soon as it identifies destination MAC address
   - No error checking Therefore errors sent with or without error to receiver
   - Collision not detected, if frames have collided also forwarded

  
  Fragment-free Switching :-
   - Read atleast 64 bytes of frame before forwarding to next node to provide error-free transmission
   - Combine speed of Cut-through Switching with error checking functionality
   - Check 64 bytes of ethernet frame where addressing information is available
   - Collision is detected it will not be forwarded further
 


 Switching Techniques :-
  Circuit Switching :-
   - Establish dedicated path between sender and receiver before communication start
   - Once connection established then will exist until connection terminated
   - When user wants to send data request signal sent to receiver then receiver send back acknowledgment (ACK)to ensure
     availability of dedicated path 
   - After receiving ack transfer data on dedicated path
   - Used in public telephone network and voice transmission
   - Fixed data transferred at time


   Space Division Switches :
    - Single transmission path accomplished in switch by using physically separate set of crosspoint
    - Achieved by using crossbar switch 
    - Crossbar switch is metallic crosspoint or semiconductor gate that enabled or disabled by control unit
    - Crossbar switch made by using semiconductor
    Ex. Xilinx crossbar switch using FPGAs
    - Switching at high speed, high capacity and nonblocking switches
    
    Crossbar Switch :-
     - N input lines and N output lines
     - It n2 intersection points known as crosspoints
     - No. of crosspoints increases as number of stations is increased Become very expensive for large switch 
    

   Multistage Switch :-
    - Splitting crossbar switch into smaller units then interconnecting them
    - Reduces number of crosspoints and if one path fails then there will be availability of another path
    - Dedicated Communication channel | Fixed bandwidth
    - Once dedicated path established only delay occurs in speed of data transmission
    - Take approx 10 seconds for connection during which no data transmitted
    - More expensive | Inefficient use | Connection dedicated therefore no other data transferred even channel free


  Message Switching :-
   - Message transferred as complete unit and routed through intermediate nodes at which it stored and forwarded
   - Not establishment dedicated path between sender and receiver
   - Destination address appended to message 
   - Provide dynamic routing as message routed through intermediate node based on available information in message
   - Each and every node stores entire message then forward to next node 
   - It treat each message as independent entity

   Advantages :-
    - Data channel shared among devices that improve efficiency of using available bandwidth
    - Most efficient route
    - Traffic congestion reduced because message is temporarily stored in nodes
    - Message priority used to manage the network
    - Message size varied Therefore, it supports unlimited size of data
   

   Disadvantages :-  
    - Sufficient storage required to store messages until message is forwarded
    - Long delay occur due to storing and forwarding facility provided by message switching technique

  
  Packet Switching :-
   - Message divided into smaller pieces then sent individually
   - Smaller pieces packet given unique number to identify their order at receiving end
   - Every packet contain information in its headers such as source address, destination address and sequence number
   - Packet travel across network and taking shortest path as possible
   - All packet reassembled at receiving end in correct order
   - If any packet is missing or corrupted then message sent to resend message
   - If correct order of packet reached then acknowledgment message sent
   - Cost-effective | Reliable | Efficient 
   - Complex protocol | High implementation cost | overloaded network require retransmission of lost packets
   
   
   Datagram Packet switching(Connectionless switching):-
   

   Virtual Circuit Switching(Connection-Oriented switching):-
    - Pre-planned route established before messages are sent
    - Call request and call accept packet used to establish connection between sender and receiver
    - If user wants to terminate connection clear signal is sent for termination



Redundant Link problems :-
 - Prevent nasty network failure
 - Provide redundancy(back up when a link fails)
 
 Broadcast Storm :- 
  - Every Switch forward broadcast frame to each other generated by another device to all its ports
  - If no loop avoidance switches flood broadcast endlessly and consume all bandwidth which Shutdown entire network 
 
 Multiple copies :-
  - Device receive multiple copies of same frame if A frame arrive from different network segments at same time

 MAC Table Thrashing :-
  - Switches use MAC address table to forward out the frames but when switch receives data from multiple switch
    at time therefore it will lead to instability in MAC table in switch C
  - Spanning Tree Protocol(STP) used to prevent these loops 
  - It block down (port) path using its own mechanism by which single path is available for frame delivery at time  



Digital Subscriber Line/Loop(DSL) :-
 - Communication medium which used to transfer data on internet through copper wire telecommunication line
 - Provide by ISP for High speed broadband Internet access also Modem
 - Splitter used to split frequency and make sure that they can’t get interrupted
 - No additional wire required because it use existing telecommunication line for both internet and telephone
 - Cost-efficient we choose different connection speeds and pricing from various providers
 - Works only on local telephone infrastructure so limited physical distance

 Symmetric DSL(SDSL) :- 
  - Provide 2MBPS equal speed both uploading(Upstream) and downloading(DownStream) data transfer for small organization

 ASymmetric DSL(ADSL) :- 
  - Provide wider frequency range for downstream transfers
  - 20 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream, it is because most users download more data than they upload
