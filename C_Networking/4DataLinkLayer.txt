Intro to Data-Link Layer :-
  - Responsible for node-to-node delivery of message  
  - Make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another over physical layer
  - When packet arrives in network it is responsibility of DLL to transmit it to Host using its MAC address
  - Packet received from Network layer divided into frames depending on frame size of NIC(Network Interface Card)   
  - Encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in header
  - Receiver’s MAC address obtained by placing ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) 
  - It request on wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and destination host will reply with its MAC address
  - Packet in Data Link layer is referred to as Frame
  - Data Link layer is handled by NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines
  - Protocol used are Ethernet, token ring, FDDI and PPP

  DLL SubLayer :-
    Logical Link Control(LLC) 
    Media Access Control(MAC)
 
 Service :-
  Framing and Link Access | Reliable Delivery | Flow control | Error Detection | Error Correction | Half & Full-Duplex

 
Error Detection :-
 - Error is situation when message received at receiver end is not identical to message transmitted
 Types :- 
 Single-Bit Error :-
  - One bit of given data unit is changed from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1
  - It not appear in Serial Data Transmission but mainly occurs in Parallel Data Transmission
  
 Burst Error :-
  - Two or more bit changed from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1
  - Determined from first corrupted bit to last corrupted bit
  -
