Intro to Networking :-
 - System which connected to the network and ready for communication known as Open System not connected and can't 
   ready known as Close System
 - Inter-connection of multiple devices that are connected using multiple path for sending/receiving data or media
 - Internet is global network comprised of smaller networks that interconnected using communication protocols
 - Internet invented by ARPANET in 1983 and controlled by 75 million server
 - Internet not governed by single authority but Ultimate authority is with Internet Society or ISOC
 
 IAB  - Internet Architecture Board review standard and allocate resources like addresses
 IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force discuss operational and technical problem
 - Backbone of internet is made by 550,000 miles of underwater cable
 - In future it compromised of different types of appliances, devices and things connected to global internet
 - IoT is about physical device and objects communicating but IoE bring network intelligence to bind all these concept
   together into cohesive system

 Networking Element :-
  - Have At least two computers 
  - Transmission medium either wired or wireless 
  - Protocols or rules that govern communication 
  - Network software such as Network Operating System 
 

 

Computer Network Architecture :-
 - Architecture defined physical and logical design of software, hardware, protocols,media and data transmission
 - Link is communication pathway that transfers data from one device to another

 Peer-To-Peer :-
  - All computers are linked together with equal privilege and responsibilities for processing data
  - Useful for small environments, usually up to 10 computers but not has dedicated server
  - Provide dedicated link between two devices
  - Less costly No dedicated server | One Stop Other Works | Easy to maintain
  - Not Centeralized system so no data backup | Security | Special permission for each computer if its goes down no data
 
 
 Multipoint Connection :-
  - Two or more devices share single link that is capacity of the channel is shared now
  Spatial Sharing        :- Several devices share link simultaneously 
  Temporal(Time) Sharing :- If users must take turns using link then it's called Time Shared Line configuration

 
 Client-Server :-
  - Designed for end users called clients to access resources from centeral computer called server
  - Server responsible for manage resources and Security
  - Client send request for resource through internet,Server receiving request and check request,Send response to client
  - Centeralized So data backup | Dedicated Server Performance Improve | Security better | Fast Resource Sharing
  - Costly(Server) | Server failure entire network stop


  Client-side :- 
   - When type URL(www.google.com) browser convert into file :-
    - GET /HTTP/1.1 (GET requesting some data from server, HTTP Protocol, 1.1. Protocol version) 
   - File converted to binary by browser then sent to the server and receive respond back to the sender IP address
   - Router send information to another and keeps on going until binary codes reach destination
 
  Server-side :- 
   - Server receive binary code and decode it and send response :- 
    - HTTP/1.1 200 ok (where 200 ok is the status)
    - Content-type:type/HTML
    - Body of page
   - Converted back to binary by server and sent to IP address that requesting it
   - Once codes received by client browser again decodes information display information
  
  
 

InterNetwork :-

  - Connect variou device which are physically separated
  - Transfer data through packets or signal form

  Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cabel :- 
   - Transfer data in form of electric signal
   - 10 Base T / 100 Base T
   - 10 means 10 MBPS(Mega Bit Per Second) data can be transfer per second
   Base has two types :-
    BaseBrand :- Only one signal transmit at time if other signal come collision arise(Dedicated cable bandwidth)
    BroadBand :- Multiple signal can be parallel transmit and cable bandwidth split into separate ranges
   - T means only 100 meter signal can be transmit than attuention occurs(Signal strength week)
   - Use in Ethernet LAN


  Coaxial Cabel :-
   - Transfer data in form of electric signal
   - 10 Base 2 / 10 Base 5
   - 2 and 5 means 200 and 500 meter distance


  Fiber Optice :- 
   - Transfer data in form of light Signal
   - Speed of light signal is - 3x10^8
   - 100 Base Fx 
   - Fx means fiber channel which cover 2km distance 


  Question :- 
    If N devices connect on network, what is maximum collision domain ? --> N
    Cable can filter or not :- 
      - If Two Lan connected it can move signal or not
      - Filter means can we decied it can move further or not
    Ans :- Yes, there is no software in cabel



 Repeater :-
  - Works on physical layer pure hardware
  - Regenerate signal over same network before signal become too weak or corrupted 
  - So as to extend length to which signal can be transmitted over same network
  - Amplifier also do this but if starting signal strength is X and it goes down Amplifier increases it 2x or 4x 
    while repeater strength will be same x -> x 
  - 2 port devices forwarding signal but not supporting filtering and maximum collision is N



 Hub :-
  - Multi-Point Repeater Hardware device
  - Support forwarding but not supporting filtering so high traffic which become collision domain problem
  - Not have intelligence to find out best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage
  - Provide small blink light functionality if any wire problem Occure or power on or off which repeater not provide
 
  Active Hub :- 
   - Own power supply, clean, boost and relay signal along with network 
   - Serve both as repeater as well as wiring center 
   - Extend maximum distance between nodes

  Passive Hub :- 
   - Collect wiring from nodes and power supply from active hub 
   - Relay signals on network without cleaning and boosting them and can’t extend distance between nodes

  Intelligent Hub :- 
   - Works like active hubs and includes remote management capabilities 
   - Provide flexible data rates to network devices 
   - Enables administrator to monitor traffic passing through hub and configure each port in hub



 Bridges :- 
  - 2 Port devices used to Connect two different LAN's works working on same protocol on data-link layer
  - Bridge is repeater with functionality of filtering content by reading MAC address of source and destination
  - Support forwarding
 
  Types of Bridges :-
   Transparent Bridges :- 
    - Stations are completely unaware of bridge’s existence Whether bridge is added or deleted from network, 
      reconfiguration of stations is unnecessary 
    - These bridges make use of two processes forwarding and learning
   
   Source Routing Bridges :- 
    - Routing operation is performed by source station and frame specifies which route to follow 
    - Host can discover frame by sending special frame called discovery frame, which spread through entire network
      using all possible paths to destination



 Switches :-
  - Multi-Port Bridges with buffer and its design boost its efficiency(No ports imply less traffic) and performance
  - Data-Link Layer device
  - Full Duplex Link
  - Perform error checking before forwarding data and correct port only so Traffic is minimal
  - Collision Domain is Zero(0) but broadcast domain remaining same



 Router :-
  - Physical or virtual internetworking device that designed to receive, analyze and forward data packet between 
    two different network/ router (Network Layer device)
  - Examine destination IP address of given data packet and use it header for forwarding packet and 
    routing tables decide best path to transfer packet
  - Use ICMP protocol to communicate between two or more network
  - Virtual router use virtual router redundancy protocol to Increase network Realibility which is done by configuring
    as default gateway and it run on server
  - Router is more capable than other network Device

  How works?
   - Analyze destination IP address(Given in packet header) --> Compare with routing table --> Transfer particular
     direction(Set of rules compute best path for route)
   - Router use modem such as cabel  or DSL model to allow communication
   - Router has port to connect different device to internet at same time
   - Routing table determine where data come from and where to send 

  Types of routing table :- Static(manually configure)  |  Dynamic (Based on network activity)

  Types of Routers :-
    Wireless Router  |  Brouter  |  Core Router  |  Edge Router  |  BroadBand Router

   Routing Information Protocol (RIP)



 Gateway :-
  - Passage to connect two networks together that work upon different networking models
  - Work as messenger agents that take data from one system, interpret it and transfer it to another system
  - It also called protocol converters and operate at any network layer
  - More complex than switches or routers

 

 Brouter :-
  - Bridging router is device that combines features of both bridge and router
  - Work either at data link layer or network layer
  - Work as router for routing packets across networks and working as bridge for filtering local area network traffic
 


 NIC(Network interface card) :-
  - Network adapter hardware component used to connect computer to the network 
  - MAC address(Stored in PROM) or Physical address encoded on chip which assigned by IEEE to identify NIC uniquely
    and has connector to connect cable to it

  - Also known as Modulator/Demodulator 
  - Convert digital data into analog signal over telephone lines
  Types :- Standard PC Modem or Dial-up Modem  |  Celluar Modem  |  Cable Modem




Topologies :-
 - Layout arrangement of different devices in network that Describe how device are connected to each other in network
 Types :- Physical(Geometric Representation of nodes)  |  Logical


 Mesh :- 
  - All devices connect to each other or say support point-to-point communication
  - Used for wireless network WAN implementations where communication failures are a critical concern
  
  Realibility :- If single system fails other system sharing data | Highest Realibility
  Cost        :- Dependant of cable quality and quantity          | High cost
  Security    :- If a and d communicate other devices(b, c) doesn't no about that
  
  Disadvantage :- High Maintenance |  Not support Multi-cast

  - N is number of nodes which represent no. of devices connected
    How many wired required (NC2 Formula) :- n(n-1)/2 
    No. of ports(Connector) Required Devices :-  (N-1) 
    Total No. of ports(Connector) Required :- N * (N-1)

  Types :-
   Full Mesh    :- Each computer connected to all available computers network
   Partial Mesh :- Not all but certain computer connected to those computer with which they communicate frequently 



 Star :- 
  - Multi-pal device are connected to each other through Centeralized device called Hub, Switches or Server
  - Support Point-to-Point
  - Coaxial cable or RJ-45 cables are used to connect computer
  - No of cabel same as no of devices :- N
  - No of ports(Connector) :- N | N * N
  - Hub fails entire network fails No Realibility | No Security | Less Cost compared to Mesh



 Bus :-
  - Backbone cabel in which multiple device are connect through drop line 
  - Tape connect Backbone cabel to Drop Line
  - Use 802.3 and 802.4 Standard network
  - Access method of bus is CSMA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access)
  - Transmit data from one-end to another in single direction
  - When send data all nodes receive data whether it has been addressed or not
  - Multi-Point connection so Collision is high  
  - Single-Point Failure so No Realibility | No Security | Less Cost compared to Mesh | Diffcult Troublshooting
  
  Attenuation - loss of signal leads to communication issues Used Repeaters to regenerate signal
  - At the end of cabel add Terminator or Repeaters(Increase Signal Strength & Join more Backbone Cabel) 
  
  No of cabel = N + 1 (N : no of devices)
  No of ports = 1     | 1 * N


  CSMA :-
   - Media access control used to control data flow so that data integrity maintained(Not packet lost)
   - Problems occur when two nodes send messages simultaneously

   CSMA CD(Collision detection) :- Access method detect collision, Once detected sender stop transmitting data 
   CSMA CA(Collision Avoidance) :- 
    - Access method avoid collision by checking whether transmission media is busy or not
    - If busy then sender waits until media becomes idle 
    


 Ring :- 
  - Multipal Bus topology design in ring shape
  - No of cabel = N + 1 (N : no of devices)
  - No of ports = 1     | 1 * N  
  - Less Realibility | No Security | Less Cost compared to Mesh | No Termination Point | Single Failure | Delay
  - Send Message in Unidirectionally  
  - Use Token-Ring to remove collision
  - Repeater used for Ring topology with large number of nodes because if someone wants to send data to last node in
    with 100 nodes then data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach 100th node
  - To prevent data loss repeaters are used in network
  Access method :-
  Token passing
   - Token is passed from one node to another until reach destination
   - Sender modifies token by putting address along with data
   - Once token received by destination device then it send acknowledgment to the sender
   Token :- Frame that circulate around network



 Tree :-
  - Combination of Star and bus topology where data flow in hierarchical structure
  - Various secondary hubs connected to central hub which contain repeater
  - Data flow from top to bottom(Center -> Secondary)
  - Multi-Point Connection and Non-Robust if backbone fails topology crashes
  - More device attached to single central hub
  - Central hub fails entire system fail and high cost of cabling
  - Only one path exists between two nodes for data transmission Thus, it form parent-child hierarchy
  - Broadband Transmission | Easily Expandable and Manageable | Error Detection |
  - Diffcult Troublshooting and Reconfiguration





Redundant Link problems :-
 - Prevent nasty network failure
 - Provide redundancy(back up when a link fails)
 
 Broadcast Storm :- 
  - Every Switch forward broadcast frame to each other generated by another device to all its ports
  - If no loop avoidance switches flood broadcast endlessly and consume all bandwidth which Shutdown entire network 
 
 
 Multiple copies :-
  - Device receive multiple copies of same frame if A frame arrive from different network segments at same time
 

 MAC Table Thrashing :-
  - Switches use MAC address table to forward out the frames but when switch receives data from multiple switch
    at time therefore it will lead to instability in MAC table in switch C
  - Spanning Tree Protocol(STP) used to prevent these loops 
  - It block down (port) path using its own mechanism by which single path is available for frame delivery at time  




Digital Subscriber Line/Loop(DSL) :-
 - Communication medium which used to transfer data on internet through copper wire telecommunication line
 - Provide by ISP for High speed broadband Internet access also Modem
 - Splitter used to split frequency and make sure that they can’t get interrupted
 - No additional wire required because it use existing telecommunication line for both internet and telephone
 - Cost-efficient we choose different connection speeds and pricing from various providers
 - Works only on local telephone infrastructure so limited physical distance

 Symmetric DSL(SDSL) :- 
  - Provide 2MBPS equal speed both uploading(Upstream) and downloading(DownStream) data transfer for small organization

 ASymmetric DSL(ADSL) :- 
  - Provide wider frequency range for downstream transfers
  - 20 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream, it is because most users download more data than they upload
