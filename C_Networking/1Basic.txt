Basic :-
 - System which connected to the network and ready for communication known as Open System
 - System which not connected to the network and can't ready for communication known as Close System
 
 - Inter-connection of multiple devices that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving 
   data or media
 - Network devices include routers, switches, hubs, and bridges

 - Layout arrangement of different devices in network known as network topology
 - Types of topology :- Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, Tree, Point to point, Hybrid

 - Internet invented by ARPANET in 1983 and controlled by 75 million server
 - Backbone of internet is made by 550,000 miles of underwater cable
 
 
 Networking Element :-
  - At least two computers 
  - Transmission medium either wired or wireless 
  - Protocols or rules that govern communication 
  - Network software such as Network Operating System 
 

 Features :- Performance | Reliability | Security 




Internet and Web :-
 - Internet is global network comprised of smaller networks that are interconnected using communication protocols
 - Internet is network of network that allows exchange data while web is way to access information through Internet
 - Internet not governed by single authority 
 - Ultimate authority for where Internet is going rest with Internet Society or ISOC
 - ISOC is voluntary membership organization whose purpose to promote global information exchange through Internet
 - IAB - Internet Architecture Board      meet regularly to review standards and allocate resources like addresses
 - IETF- Internet Engineering Task Force  meet regularly to discuss operational and technical problem


 URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) :-
  - URI can be name, locator or both for online resource whereas URL is just locator
  - URLs are subset of URIs
  - URL is human-readable text that designed to replace IP addresses numbers that computer use communicate with server
  - URL consists of protocol, domain name, and path 
  
  Syntax :- protocol://WebSiteName.topLevelDomain/path
   Protocol       - HTTP or HTTPS
   WebSiteName    - google
   topLevelDomain - .com, .edu, .in
   path           - Specific folder and/or subfolders that are on given website




Internet and Web Programming :-
 Client-side :- 
  - When type URL like www.google.com browser convert into file containing :-
    - GET /HTTP/1.1 (GET requesting some data from server, HTTP Protocol, 1.1. Protocol version) 
  - File converted to binary by browser then sent to the server
  - Go to destination and respond if it is received by sender only because of IP address
  - Router send information to another and keeps on going until binary codes reach destination
 
 Server-side :- 
  - Server receive binary code and decode it and send response :- 
    - HTTP/1.1 200 ok (where 200 ok is the status)
    - Content-type:type/HTML
    - Body of page
  - Converted back to binary by server and sent to IP address that is requesting it
  - Once codes received by client browser again decodes information display information
  



Internet Of Everything (IoE) :-
 - Philosophy in which technology future is compromised of different types of appliances, devices and things 
   connected to global internet
 - IoT is about physical device and objects communicating but IoE bring network intelligence to bind all these concept
   together into cohesive system



Topologies :-
 - Describe how device are connected to each other 
 - Arrangement of network that comprises nodes and connecting line via sender and receiver referred as network topology

 Mesh :- 
  - All devices connect to each other or say support point-to-point communication
  
  Realibility :- If single system fails other system sharing data | Highest Realibility
  Cost        :- Dependant of cable quality and quantity          | High cost
  Security    :- If a and d communicate other devices(b, c) doesn't no about that
  
  Disadvantage :-
   - High Maintenance
   - Not support Multi-cast

  - N is number of nodes which represent no. of devices connected
  - How many wired required (NC2 Formula) :- n(n-1)/2 
  - No. of ports(Connector) Required Devices :-  (N-1) 
  - Total No. of ports(Connector) Required :- N * (N-1)



 Star :- 
  - Multi-pal device are connected to each other through Centeralized device called Hub(Multi-Port Device)
  - Hub is central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node
  - Support Point-to-Point
  - No of cabel same as no of devices :- N
  - No of ports(Connector) :- N | N * N
  - Hub fails entire network fails No Realibility | No Security | Less Cost compared to Mesh



 Bus :-
  - Backbone, Coaxial-cabel, Thick Ethernet wire(High-Bandwith) in which multiple device are connecte through drop line 
  - Tape connect Backbone cabel to Drop Line
  - Transmit data from one-end to another in single direction
  - Multi-Point connection so Collision is high  
  - No of cabel = N + 1 (N : no of devices)
  - No of ports = 1     | 1 * N
  - Single-Point Failure so No Realibility | No Security | Less Cost compared to Mesh
  - At the end of cabel we add Terminator or Repeaters(Increase Signal Strength & Join more Backbone Cabel) 


 
 Ring :- 
  - Multipal Bus topology design in ring shape
  - No of cabel = N + 1 (N : no of devices)
  - No of ports = 1     | 1 * N  
  - Less Realibility | No Security | Less Cost compared to Mesh
  - Send Message in Unidirectionally  
  - Use Token-Ring to remove collision
  - Repeater used for Ring topology with large number of nodes because if someone wants to send data to last node in
    with 100 nodes then data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach 100th node
  - To prevent data loss repeaters are used in network



 Tree :-
  - Variation of Star topology where data flow in hierarchical structure
  - Various secondary hubs connected to central hub which contain repeater
  - Data flow from top to bottom(Center -> Secondary)
  - Multi-Point Connection and Non-Robust if backbone fails topology crashes
  - More device attached to single central hub
  - Central hub fails entire system fail and high cost of cabling



Types of Area Networks :-
 
 LAN(Local Area Network) :-
  - Connect network device in such a way that personal computers share data, tools and program
  - Connect device by switch or stack of switches using private addressing scheme as defined by TCP/IP protocol
  - Private addresses are unique in relation to other computers on local network 
  - Routers found at boundary of LAN connecting them to larger WAN
  - Cover smaller geographical area | Data transmit at very fast rate
  - Communication medium used for LAN has twisted-pair cables and coaxial cables    


 MAN(Metropolitan Area Network) :-
  - Larger than LAN and smaller than WAN
  - Cover large geographical area and may serve as ISP (Internet Service Provider)
  - Provide High-speed connectivity but hard to design and maintain
  - Network delay | Fault tolerance Less | Congestion High
  - Use Modem and Wire/Cable for data transmission
  

 WAN(Wide Area Network) :-
  - Cover Large geographical area might be confined within bounds of state or country
  - Types of WAN :- Switched WAN | Point-To-Point WAN
  - Fault tolerance Less | Congestion High
  - Communication medium used for WAN is PSTN(Public Switched Telephone Network) or Satellite Link
  - Devices used for transmission of data through WAN are Optic wires, Microwaves, and Satellites


 MANET(Mobile Ad Hoc Network) :-
  - Consist of set of mobile nodes connected wirelessly in self-configured, self-healing network without having 
    fixed infrastructure  
  - Free to move randomly as network topology changes frequently
  - Each node behaves as router as they forward traffic to other specified nodes in the network
  Types :- Vehicular(VANET) | SmartPhone(SPANC) | InternetBased(iMANET) | 

 PAN (Personal Area Network)   | SAN (Storage Area Network)
 VPN (Virtual Private Network) | EPN (Enterprise Private Network)



Redundant Link problems :-
 - Prevent nasty network failure
 - Provide redundancy(back up when a link fails)
 
 Broadcast Storm :- 
  - Every Switch forward broadcast frame to each other generated by another device to all its ports
  - If no loop avoidance switches flood broadcast endlessly and consume all bandwidth which Shutdown entire network 
 
 
 Multiple copies :-
  - Device receive multiple copies of same frame if A frame arrive from different network segments at same time
 

 MAC Table Thrashing :-
  - Switches use MAC address table to forward out the frames but when switch receives data from multiple switch
    at time therefore it will lead to instability in MAC table in switch C
  - Spanning Tree Protocol(STP) used to prevent these loops 
  - It block down (port) path using its own mechanism by which single path is available for frame delivery at time  



Type of line configuration :-
 - Network is two or more devices connected through link
 - Link is communication pathway that transfers data from one device to another
 
 Point-to-Point Connection :-
  - Provide dedicated link between two devices
  - Use actual length of wire or cable to connect two ends but other option such as microwave or satellite also possible
 
 Multipoint Connection :-
  - Two or more devices share single link that is capacity of the channel is shared now
  Spatial Sharing :- Several devices share link simultaneously 
  Temporal(Time) Sharing :- If users must take turns using link then it's called Time Shared Line configuration



Digital Subscriber Line/Loop(DSL) :-
 - Communication medium which used to transfer data on internet through copper wire telecommunication line
 - Provide by ISP for High speed broadband Internet access also Modem
 - Splitter used to split frequency and make sure that they can’t get interrupted
 - No additional wire required because it use existing telecommunication line for both internet and telephone
 - Cost-efficient we choose different connection speeds and pricing from various providers
 - Works only on local telephone infrastructure so limited physical distance

 Symmetric DSL(SDSL) :- 
  - Provide 2MBPS equal speed both uploading(Upstream) and downloading(DownStream) data transfer for small organization

 ASymmetric DSL(ADSL) :- 
  - Provide wider frequency range for downstream transfers
  - 20 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream, it is because most users download more data than they upload



Scrambling in Digital electronic :-
 - Signal that represent data also be digital or analog
 - To send signal must convert data into signal 
 - This conversion can be Analog to Analog, Analog to Digital, Digital to Analog or Digital to Digital
 - Digital to Digital conversion involves three techniques – Line Coding, Block Coding, and Scrambling 
 - Line Coding always needed whereas Block Coding and Scrambling depending upon need
 - Scrambling not increase number of bits and provide synchronization 
 - Problem with technique like Bipolar AMI(Alternate Mark Inversion) is that continuous sequence of zero’s create 
   synchronization problems one solution to this is Scrambling
 

 Types of Line Coding :-
  - Self-synchronizing both receiver and sender clock should be synchronized
  - Error-detecting capability and less complexity

  Unipolar 
   - Non Return to Zero(NRZ) positive voltage defines bit 1 and the zero voltage defines bit 0
   - Signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit thus it is called NRZ
   - Uses more power as compared to polar scheme to send one bit per unit line resistance

  Polar (eg. NRZ-L, NRZ-I, RZ, and Biphase – Manchester and differential Manchester)
   - NRZ-L and NRZ-I similar to Unipolar but use two levels of amplitude (voltages)
   - Return to Zero(RZ) uses three values positive, negative and zero

  Bipolar (eg. AMI and Pseudoternary) | ultilevel | Multitransition
 


 Scrambling Techniques :-
  B8ZS(Bipolar with 8-zero substitution) :-
   - Similar to Bipolar AMI except when eight consecutive zero-level voltages are encountered they are replaced by 
     sequence "000VB0VB"
   - V(Violation) is non-zero voltage which means signal have same polarity as previous non-zero voltage
   - B(Bipolar) also non-zero voltage level which is accordance with AMI rule


  HDB3(High-density bipolar3-zero) :-
   - Four consecutive zero-level voltages are replaced with sequence “000V” or “B00V”
 
 
 
Manchester encoding and differential manchester encoding :-
 - Transmission of data means convert upper layer digital data(0,1 form) to analog or digital signal
 - To encode data digital to digital we use manchester and differential manchester encoding
 - Dr.thomas and IEEE802.3 convention
 Manchester :-
  0 -->  -|_
  1 -->  _|-

 Different Manchester Encoding :-
  0 --> |-|_ , |_|- 
  1 --> -|_  , _|-
