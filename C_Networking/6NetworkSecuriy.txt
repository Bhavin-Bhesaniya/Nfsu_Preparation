Introduction to Network Security :-
 - Measures taken by business or organization to monitor and prevent unauthorized access from outside attacker
 - Network Administrator control access to data and software on network
 - Network administrator assign user ID and password to authorized person

 Aspect of Network Security :-
  Privacy : 
   - Sender and Receiver expect confidentiality
   - Only sender and receiver able to understand transmitted message 
   - Therefore requirement to encrypt message so that message cannot be intercepted 
   
  Message Integrity :- 
   - Data must arrive at receiver exactly as it was sent 
   - There no change in data content during transmission either maliciously or accidentally  
   
  End-point authentication :-  
   - Receiver is sure of sender(Identity), no imposter has sent message
  
  Non-Repudiation :- 
   - Receiver prove that received message come from specific sender 
   - Sender must not deny sending message that he or she send 
   - Burden of proving identity comes on receiver
   Ex :- Money transfer



Privacy :-
 - Encryption/decryption technique is used to achieve privacy form unauthorized parties 
 - Ensures that eavesdropper cannot understand content of message

 Encryption/Decryption :-
  Encryption :- Convert original information into another form and send unintelligible message over network(ciphertext)
  Decryption :- Reverses Encryption process in order to transform message back to original form  
  Types of technique :- Secret key Encryption/Decryption  |  Public key Encryption/Decryption

  Secret Key Encryption/Decryption technique :-
   Diagram :- plaintext --> Encryption --> ciphertext --> Network --> ciphertext --> Decryption --> plaintext
                                |------------------- Shared Secret Key ------------------|
   - Same key is used by both sender and receiver
   - Sender use secret key and encryption algorithm to encrypt data receiver uses for decryption
   - Algorithm used for encryption is inverse of algorithm used for decryption 
   - It means that if encryption algorithm uses combination of addition and multiplication then decryption algorithm
     uses combination of subtraction and division
   - Secret key encryption algorithm is also known as symmetric encryption algorithm because same key used 
   - Secret code used by computer to encrypt information before it sent over network to another computer
   
   Data Encryption Standard (DES) :-
    - Designed by IBM and adopted by U.S. government as standard encryption method for nonmilitary and nonclassified use
    - DES standard used for encryption and it is form of Secret Key Cryptography
    Efficient :- Take less time to encrypt message because small key size
      
    Disadvantages :- 
     - Each pair of user must have secret key, there are N(N-1)/2 secret keys, (100 n = 50 KEY require)
     - Key Distribution among different parties very difficult 
     
  
  Public Key Encryption/Decryption technique :-
   There are two keys in public key encryption :- Private key and Public key
   - Private key given to receiver while public key provided to public
   - Public key used by sender is public while private key used by receiver is different for each individual
   - Most commonly used public key algorithm is known as RSA
                                                                                      |-- Public key 
   Diagram :- plaintext --> Encryption --> ciphertext --> Network --> ciphertext --> Decryption --> plaintext
                                                                                      |-- Private Key
                                                                                      
   Advantage :-
    - Restriction of private key encryption is sharing of secret key 
    - Third party cannot use this key 
    - In public key encryption, each entity creates pair of keys and they keep private one and distribute public key
    - Number of key in public key encryption is reduced tremendously
     
   Disadvantage :- 
    Speed : Slower than secret-key encryption because different key used both side
    Authentication : Does not have built-in authentication, So message can be interpreted or intercepted
    Inefficient : 
     - Complexity, Large number needed, Converting plaintext into ciphertext using long key take lot of time
     - Efficient for short messages not for long message
    

  Difference Secret vs Public :- 
   Comparison	Secret Key Encryption(Symmetric Key)	  Public Key Encryption(Asymmetric Key)
   Define	    Single shared key Use	                  Private and Public two key use
   Efficieny	Efficient, Used for large amount of data  Inefficient, used only for short messages
   Speed	    High single key                           Slow speed uses two different keys
   Algorithm	DES, 3DES, AES & RCA	                  Diffie-Hellman, RSA
   Purpose	    Transmit bulk data	                      Share keys securely



Digital Signature :-
 - Used to validate authenticity and integrity of message 
 - Basic idea behind Digital Signature is to sign document 
 - When we send document electronically, we also sign it 
 - We sign document in two ways : Sign whole document  |  Sign digest
 Note :- Digital Signature does not provide privacy for privacy another layer of encryption/decryption applied

 Digital Signature used to achieve following three aspect :-
  Integrity :- 
   - Preserve integrity of message because if any malicious attack intercept message and partially or totally changes
     it then decrypted message would be impossible

  Authentication :- 
   - User X send message pretending that it is coming from someone else(user A) user X use her own private key to
     encrypt message 
   - Message decrypted by using public key of user A 
   - Therefore this makes message unreadable 
   - Encryption with X's private key and decryption with A's public key results in garbage value
  
  Non-Repudiation :- 
   - If sender denies sending message, then her private key corresponding to her public key is tested on plaintext 
   - If decrypted message is same as original message, then we know that sender has sent message


 Signing Whole Document :-
  - Public key encryption technique used to sign document 
  - Roles of public and private key are different here 
  - Sender use private key to encrypt message while receiver uses public key of sender to decrypt message
 

 Signing the Digest :-
  - If message is long than sender sign digest of document instead of whole document
  - Sender create miniature version digest) of document and then sign it, receiver check signature of digest
  - Hash function used to create fixed-size digest from variable-length message
  Common hash function :- MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA-1(Secure Hash Algorithm 1) 
  - First one produce 120-bit digest while second one produce 160-bit digest

  Hash function must have two properties :- 
   - Digest must be one way (Digest only be created from message but not vice versa)
   - Hashing is one-to-one function (Two message not create same digest)


  Following steps taken to ensure security :-
   - Digest message created by using hash function and encrypted by using sender's private key
   - After digest encrypted then it attached to original message and sent to receiver
   - Receiver receive original message and encrypted digest and separates two 
   - Receiver implement hash function on original message to create second digest and it also decrypt received digest
     by using public key of sender 
   - If both digest are same then all aspect of security are preserved
  
   At Sender site :-
    Message --------------------- (Signed Digest + Message) -->  To B
      |                                     |                               
     Hash                                   |
      |                                     |
     Digest --> Encrypt(A'Private)--> Signed Digest


   At Receiver site :-
                    B
    From A -->     (Signed Digest + Message)
    A's Public Key        |             |
        |                 |             |
        ------------>  decrypt        Hash
                          |---Compare---|  



PGP(Pretty Good Privacy) :-
 - Invented by Phil Zimmermann
 - Provide all four aspects of security in sending of email
 - Use digital signature(Combination of hashing and public key encryption)
 - Also use combination of secret key encryption and public key encryption to provide privacy 
 - Therefore, digital signature uses one hash function, one secret key and two private-public key pairs
 - PGP is open source and freely available software package for email security
 - Provide authentication through Digital Signature, confidentiality through use of symmetric block encryption
 - Compression by using ZIP algorithm and EMAIL compatibility using radix-64 encoding scheme


 Step taken by PGP to create secure e-mail at sender site :-
  - E-mail message hashed by using hashing function to create digest
  - Digest then encrypted to form signed digest by using sender's private key and then signed digest is added to 
    original email message
  - Original message and signed digest are encrypted by using one-time secret key created by sender
  - Secret key encrypted by using receiver's public key
  - Both encrypted secret key and encrypted combination of message and digest are sent together


 PGP at Sender site :-
  Digital Signature --> Privacy    
                        One/Time Secret Key                 B's Public
                                ------------> Encrypt ------  |  
                        Encrypt------------------------------ + ----> Encrypted(Secret key & Message + Digest) 
              
  - Receiver receive combination of encrypted secret key and message digest is received
  - Encrypted secret key decrypted by using receiver's private key to get one-time secret key
  - Secret key then used to decrypt combination of message and digest
  - Digest decrypted by using sender's public key and original message hashed by using hash function to create digest
  - Both digest are compared if both of them are equal means that all aspects of security are preserved

 
 Disadvantages of PGP Encryption :
  Administration is difficult | Compatibility(Verson) issues | Complexity | No Recovery(Loss Password)
