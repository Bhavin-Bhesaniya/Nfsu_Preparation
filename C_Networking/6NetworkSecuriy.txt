Introduction to Network Security :-
 - Measures taken by business or organization to monitor and prevent unauthorized access from outside attacker
 - Network Administrator control access to data and software on network
 
 Types of attack :- 
  Interruption :- An asset of the system is destroyed or becomes unavailable or unusable
  Interception :- Unauthorized party gains access to an asset        | Attack on Confidentiality 
  Modification :- Unauthorized party gains access and dameged asset  | Attack on integrity
  Fabrication  :- Insert counterfeit object into system              | Attack on authenticity


 Aspect of Network Security :-
  Privacy                  :- Only sender and receiver able to understand transmitted message 
  Message Integrity        :- Data must arrive at receiver exactly as it was sent 
  End-point authentication :- Receiver is sure of sender(Identity), no imposter has sent message
  Non-Repudiation          :- Receiver prove that received message come from specific sender | Ex :- Money transfer
 

 CIA(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) :-
  - Model that designed to guide policies for information security within organization
  
  Confidentiality :-
   - Only authorized individuals/systems can view sensitive or classified information 
   - Use encryption techniques to safeguard data so that even if attacker gain access to not be able to decrypt it 
   Types :- AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) | DES(Data Encryption Standard) | VPN tunnel (Move data securely network)

  Integrity :-
   - To check Data is modified or not
   Types :- SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)(160-bit) and MD5(Message Direct 5)(128-bit)
   
  Availability :
   - Network administrator maintain hardware make regular upgrade have plan for fail-over and prevent bottleneck
   - Attack such as DoS or DDoS may render network unavailable as resources of network get exhausted 
   
   

Encryption / Decryption :- 
 Encryption :- Convert original information into another form and send unintelligible message over network(ciphertext)
 Decryption :- Reverse Encryption process in order to transform message back to original form(Original text)
 
 Symmetric key encryption algorithm :-
  Diagram :- Plain --> Encryption --> Cipher --> Network --> Cipher --> Decryption --> Plain
                       |----------------- Shared Secret Key ---------------|
  - Same key used by both sender and receiver
  - Encryption algorithm use combination of addition and multiplication then decryption algorithm
    uses combination of subtraction and division
  - Secret code used before sent over network to another computer
  Types :- DES- 56bits | 3DES- 192bits | AES(128, 192, 256-bits(2^56))
  Syntax :- NC2
   
  
 ASymmetric encryption algorithm :-
  Two keys used :- Private key and Public key
  - Private key given to receiver while public key provided public
  - Public key used by sender public while private key used by receiver that different for each individual
  - RSA(Rivest, Samir, Adelman) algorithm used :- 2N
                                                                                     |-- Public key 
  Diagram :- Plain --> Encryption --> Cipher --> Network -->  Cipher --> Decryption --> Plaintext
                                                                                     |-- Private Key
                                                                                      
  Advantage :-
   - Third party cannot use this key 
   - Restriction of private key encryption is sharing of secret key 
   - In public key encryption, each entity creates pair of keys and they keep private one and distribute public key
   - Number of key in public key encryption is reduced tremendously


  Disadvantage :- 
   Speed          : Slower because different key used both side
   Authentication : Does not built-in authentication, So message interpreted or intercepted
   Inefficient    : Complexity | Large number needed | Converting using long key takes lot of time 
   

 Difference Secret vs Public :- 
   Comparison	  Secret Key Encryption(Symmetric Key)	  Public Key Encryption(Asymmetric Key)
   Define	        Single shared key 	                    Private and Public key
   Efficieny	    Used for large data                     Inefficient, for short message
   Speed	        High                                    Slow
   Algorithm	    DES, 3DES, AES & RCA	                  Diffie-Hellman, RSA
   Purpose	      Transmit bulk data	                    Share keys securely



Substitution Techniques :-
 - Each Letters of plaintext replaced by other letter or by numbers or symbol 
 - If plaintext replacing with ciphertext bit pattern known as Caesar Cipher
 Syntax Encryption :-  C = E(p) = (p + k) mod(26)
 Syntax Decryption :-  P = D(c) = (C - k) mod(26)
 - Playfair algorithm based on use of 5 X 5 matrix of letters constructed using keyword known as Playfair Cipher



Digital Signature(Sign document)(Combination of hashing and public key encryption):-
 - Validate authenticity and message integrity but Not provide privacy
 - When send document sign it in two ways : Sign whole document  |  Sign digest

 Integrity :- Preserve integrity of message 
 
 Authentication :- 
  - User X send pretending that coming from someone else(user A) user X use own private key to encrypt message 
  - Message decrypted by using public key of user A which makes message unreadable 
  - Encryption with X's private key and decryption with A's public key result in garbage value
  

 Non-Repudiation :- 
  - Sender denies sending message then her private key corresponding to her public key tested on plaintext 
  - If decrypted message same as original message then we know that sender has sent message


 Types :-
  Signing Whole Document :- Sender private key encrypt message while receiver use public key of sender to decrypt message

  Signing Digest :- 
   - If Message longer than sender sign digest of document instead of whole document
   - Hash function used to create fixed-size digest from variable-length message
   - Digest must be one way (Digest only be created from message but not vice versa)
   - Hashing is one-to-one function (Two message not create same digest)
   Common hash function :- MD5(Message Digest 5)(120-bit) and SHA-1(Secure Hash Algorithm 1)(160-bit)
  

 Following steps taken to ensure security :-
  - Digest message created by using hash function and encrypted by using sender's private key
  - After digest encrypted then it attached to original message and sent to receiver
  - Receiver receive original message and encrypted digest and separates two 
  - Receiver implement hash function on original message to create second digest and it also decrypt received digest
    by using public key of sender 
  - If both digest are same then all aspect of security are preserved
  


Data Encryption Standard (DES) :-
 - Designed by IBM and adopted by U.S. government for nonmilitary and nonclassified use
 - Encryption data in form of Secret Key Cryptography
 Efficient :- Take less time to encrypt message because small key size
      
 Disadvantages :-  
  - Each pair of user must have secret key, N(N-1)/2 secret key, (100 n = 50 KEY require)
  - Key Distribution difficult 



PGP(Pretty Good Privacy) :-
 - Open source and freely available software package for email security Invented by Phil Zimmermann 
 - Provide all four aspects of security in sending of email
 - Use digital signature one hash function, one secret key and two private-public key pairs
 - Authentication through Digital Signature, Confidentiality through symmetric block encryption
 - Compression by using ZIP algorithm and EMAIL compatibility using radix-64 encoding scheme


 Step taken by PGP to create secure e-mail at sender site :-
  - E-mail message hashed to create digest 
  - Then Digest encrypted -> signed digest by using sender private key and then added original email message to digest
  - Original message and signed digest are encrypted by using one-time secret key created by sender
  - Secret key encrypted by using receiver's public key
  - Both encrypted secret key and encrypted combination of message and digest are sent together

 Dis :- Administration difficult | Compatibility(Verson) issues | Complexity | No Recovery(Loss Password)



Firewall :-
 - Network security device either hardware or software-based which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and 
   based on defined set of security rules it accept, reject/block or drops(No reply) that specific traffic
 - Firewall match network traffic against rule set defined in its table 
 - Rule defined on firewall based on necessity and security policies of organization
 - Establish barrier between secured internal networks and outside untrusted network such as Internet
 - Before Firewall, network security was performed by Access Control Lists(ACLs) residing on routers 
 - ACL rules determine whether network access should be granted or denied to specific IP address
 - But ACL cannot determine nature of packet it is blocking and not capacity to keep threats out of network 
 - Most traffic which reach on firewall is one of these three major Transport Layer protocols :- TCP, UDP or ICMP 
 - All these types have source address and destination address and port number
 - ICMP uses type code instead of port number which identifies purpose of packet

 
 Default policy :- 
  - Difficult to explicitly cover every possible rule on firewall 
  - Firewall always have default policy that consists of action (accept, reject or drop)
  - If no rule is defined about SSH connection to server on firewall it follow default policy 
   

 Generation of Firewall :-
  First Generation-Packet Filtering Firewall :-  
   - Control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packet and allowing them to pass or stop based on 
     source and destination IP address, protocol and port 
   - Analyses traffic at transport protocol layer(but mainly uses first 3 layers)
   - Treat each packet in isolation 
   - No ability to tell whether packet is part of existing stream of traffic
   - It allow or deny packet based on unique packet header
   - Maintains filtering table which decide whether packet will be forwarded or discarded 
   
  Second Generation- Stateful Inspection Firewall :- 
   - Determine connection state of packet 
   - Keep track of state of networks connection travelling across it, such as TCP stream 
   - So filtering decisions not only based on defined rules but also on packet’s history in state table

  Third Generation-Application Layer Firewall :- 
   - Inspect and filter packets on any OSI layer
   - Ability to block specific content, also recognize when certain application and protocol(like HTTP, FTP) are misuse
   - It is hosts that run proxy servers 
   - Proxy firewall prevent direct connection between either side of firewall, each packet has to pass through proxy 
   Note :- Application Layer Firewall also used as Network Address Translator(NAT)

  Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW) :- 
   - Stop modern security breaches like advance malware attack and application-layer attacks 
   - Consist of Deep Packet Inspection, Application Inspection, SSL/SSH inspection and many functionalities to protect
    
 
 Types of Firewall :-
  Host-based Firewall :- 
   - Installed on each network node which control incoming and outgoing packet 
   - Software application comes as part of OS 
   - Required because network firewall cannot provide protection inside trusted network 
   - Protect each host from attacks and unauthorized access

  Network-based Firewall :- 
   - Function on network level that filter all incoming and outgoing traffic across network 
   - Protect internal network by filtering traffic using rules defined on firewall
   - It might have two or more network interface cards(NICs) 
   - It is usually dedicated system with proprietary software installed

  Packet-filter Firewall :-
   - Works in network layer that applies set of rules on each packet based on outcome decide forwarded or not
   Diagram :-   [ Allowed Packet ]  <--  ( Packet-Filtering router )    <-- Incoming Packet
                                                    |
                                                Disallowed Packet

  Application Gateway(Bastion Host)(Application proxies) :-
   - Operates at application level that provide most secure type data connection because they examine every layer of 
     communication includeing Application data

                                                          |
                                                    Proxy Service
