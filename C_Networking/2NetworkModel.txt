OSI and TCP/IP Model :-

OSI(Open System Interconnection) :-
 - Developed by ISO(International Organization for Standardization) in 1984
 - Provide standard for sending and receiving data with other device using network functionality
 - If client and server on same machine, will managed by OS (Inter-Process Communication)
 - So in Computer network must be client and server both machine required physically separated
 
 OSI model divided into 7 layers :-
  Physical --> Data Link --> Network --> Transport --> Session --> Presentation -->  Application
        Hardware Layer (1,2,3)          Heart of OSI           Software Layer(5,6,7)
                                   Sender -->   <-- Receiver

 Functionality :-
  Mandatory :-
   Error Control - Receiver receive same message or not
   Flow Control  - Amount of data we send
   Multiplexing / Demultiplexing :- Process that run on machine identify which process send data or receive data

  Optional :-
   Encryption | Decryption | Cryptographic
   CheckPoint :- Downloading data at some point of time we need to add check point (Resume Downloading)
 
 - OSI model acts as reference model and not implemented on Internet because of its late invention
 - Model being used is TCP/IP model


 Physical Layer(Layer 1) :-
  - Lowest layer responsible for physical connection between device
  - Contain information in the form of bits
  - Responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to next
  - When receiving data this layer get signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s send them to Data Link layer
  
  Functionality :-
   Bit Synchronization - Using clock, controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at bit level
   Bit rate control    - Defines transmission rate(Number of bits sent per second)
   Physical Topologies - Specifies way in which different devices/nodes are arranged in network
   Transmission mode   - Data flow between device in form of Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex

  Device :- Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables 



 Data-Link Layer :-
  - Responsible for node-to-node delivery of message  
  - Make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another over physical layer
  - When packet arrives in network it is responsibility of DLL to transmit it to Host using its MAC address
  - Packet received from Network layer divided into frames depending on frame size of NIC(Network Interface Card)   
  - Encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in header
  - Receiver’s MAC address obtained by placing ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) 
  - It request on wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and destination host will reply with its MAC address
  - Packet in Data Link layer is referred to as Frame
  - Data Link layer is handled by NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines
  DLL SubLayer :-
    Logical Link Control(LLC) 
    Media Access Control(MAC)
  

  Functionality :- 
   Framing - Provides way for sender to transmit set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver using bit patterns
   Physical Addressing - After creating frames add MAC address(Physical) of sender and receiver in header of each frame
   Error Control  - Detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames
   Flow Control   - Data rate must be constant on both sides
   Access Control - Single communication channel shared by multiple devices MAC sub-layer determine which device has
                    control over channel at given time
    
  Device :- Switch & Bridges

 

 Network Layer(Layer 3) :-
  - Transmission data from one host to other located in different networks
  - Suppor Packet routing(Select shortest path from available routes)
  - Sender & receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header
  - Segment in Network layer is referred as Packet 
  
  Functionality :-
   Routing : Layer Protocols determine which route suitable from source to destination 
   Logical Addressing :- 
    - Sender & receiver’s IP addresses placed in Header by network layer to Identify each device on network uniquely 

  Device :- Router



 Transport Layer(Layer 4) :-
  - Provide services to application layer and takes services from network layer   
  - Data in transport layer referred to as Segments
  - Responsible for End to End Delivery of complete message
  - Provide acknowledgement of successful data transmission and re-transmits data if error found
  - Transport layer is operated by the Operating System using system call

  Sender-Side :-
   - Receive formatted data from upper layers perform Segmentation and implements Flow & Error control 
   - Add Source and Destination port number in its header and forward segmented data to Network Layer
   - Sender needs to know port number associated with receiver’s(Destination) application
  
  Receiver-Side :-
   - Read port number from its header and forward received Data to respective application
   - Perform sequencing and reassembling of segmented data


  Functionality :-
   Segmentation and Reassembly -
    - Accept message from (session) layer breaks into smaller units
    - Each segments produced has header associated with it
    - At destination station reassembles message
  
   Service Point Addressing :-
    - Specifying Service Point or Port address in header makes sure that message delivered to correct process


  Service :-
   Connection-Oriented :- 
    Phase :- Connection Establish --> Data Transfer --> Termination / Disconnection
    - Receiving device send acknowledgement back to source after packet or group of packets is received 
    - Reliable and Secure

   Connection-less :-
    Phase :- Data Transfer
    - Receiver does not acknowledge receipt of packet
    - Much faster and more reliable than connection-oriented



 Session Layer(Layer 5) :-
  - Establishment connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication and ensures security
  - Session, Presentation and Application layer are integrated as single layer in TCP/IP model as “Application Layer”
  - Implementation of these 3 layers is done by network application itself

  Functionality :-
   Session establishment, maintenance and termination :- Allow Process to do
   Synchronization :- Allow process to add check-Point helps to identify error and data loss is avoided
   Dialog Control  :- Allow two systems to start communication with each other in half-duplex or full-duplex


 
 Presentation Layer(Layer 6) :-
  - Also known as Translation layer
  - Data from application layer extracted and manipulated as per required format to transmit over network
  
  Functionality :-
   Translation : ASCII to EBCDIC
   
   Encryption / Decryption :- 
    - Encryption translates data into another form or code 
    - Encrypted data known as ciphertext and decrypted data known as plain text 
    - Key value used for encrypting as well as decrypting data
   
   Compression : Reduces number of bits that need to be transmitted on network
 


 Application Layer(Layer 7) :-
  - Very top of OSI Model which implemented by network application
  - These applications produce data which has to be transferred over network
  - Layer serves as window for application services to access network and for displaying received information to user
  - Application – Browsers, Skype Messenger, etc. 
  - Application Layer is also called Desktop Layer

  Functionality :-
   - Network Virtual Terminal
   - FTAM-File transfer access and management
   - Mail Services
   - Directory Services

  7 Layer(OSI)    5 Layer(TCP/IP) 4 Layer(TCP/IP)



TCP/IP Model :-
 - Designed and developed by Department of Defense (DoD) in 1960s and based on standard protocols 
 - First layer is Process layer on the behalf of sender and Network Access layer on the behalf of receiver
 
 Layer :-
  - Process/Application Layer
  - Host-to-Host/Transport Layer
  - Internet Layer
  - Network Access/Link Layer
  
 Network Access Layer :-
  - Corresponds to combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of OSI model 
  - Hardware addressing and protocols present in this layer allows for physical transmission of data
  - ARP is protocol of Internet layer but there conflict about declaring it as protocol of Internet or Network layer
  - It described as residing in layer 3 being encapsulated by layer 2 protocols


 Internet Layer :- 
  - Prallels functions of OSI’s Network layer
  - Responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network
  
  Protocol that used :-
   IP(Internet Protocol) 
    - Delivering packets from source host to destination host by looking at IP addresses in packet headers 
    2 versions :- IPv4 and IPv6 
     - IPv4 most of websites are using currently 
     - But IPv6 is growing as number of IPv4 addresses are limited in number when compared to number of Users

   ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) 
    - Encapsulated within IP datagrams and responsible for providing hosts with information about network problems

   ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) 
    - Find hardware address of host from known IP address 
    ARP Types :- Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, Gratuitous ARP and Inverse ARP



 Host-to-Host Layer :-
  - Analogous to transport layer of OSI model
  - Responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data 
  - It shields upper-layer applications from complexities of data
  Protocol that used :- 
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
    - Provide reliable and error-free communication between end systems 
    - Perform sequencing and segmentation of data 
    - Acknowledgment feature and control flow of data through flow control mechanism 
    - Very effective protocol but has a lot of overhead due to such features 
    - Increased overhead leads to increased cost.
   
   User Datagram Protocol (UDP)  
    - go-to protocol if application not require reliable transport as it is very cost-effective 
    - Unlike TCP, which is connection-oriented protocol, UDP is connectionless



 Application Layer :-
  - Perform functions of top three layers of OSI model :- Application, Presentation and Session Layer 
  - Responsible for node-to-node communication and controls user-interface specifications 
  - Some of protocols present in this layer are :- 
    HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SSH, SMTP, SNMP, NTP, DNS, DHCP, NFS, X Window, LPD 
  
  Protocols that used :-
   HTTP / HTTPS(Hypertext transfer protocol / -Secure) 
    - Used by World Wide Web to manage communications between web browsers and servers
    - HTTPS is combination of HTTP with SSL(Secure Socket Layer) 
    - Efficient where browser need to fill out forms, sign in, authenticate and carry out bank transactions
   
   SSH(Secure Shell) :- 
    - Terminal emulations software similar to Telnet 
    - Maintain encrypted connection 
    - It sets up secure session over TCP/IP connection
   
   NTP(Network Time Protocol) :- 
    - Used to synchronize clocks standard time source on computer 
    - Very useful in situations like bank transactions 
    - Suppose you carry out transaction where computer reads time at 2:30 PM while server records it at 2:28 PM 
    - Server can crash very badly if it’s out of sync
