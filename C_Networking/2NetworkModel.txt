OSI and TCP/IP Model :-
- Set of layers and protocols is known as network architecture

Layerd Architecture :-
 - Networking concept divided into several layer and each layer assigned particular task
 - Lower layer add its services to higher layer to provide full set of service to manage communication and run app
 - Independent layer so modification in layer not affect other layers
 - layer n in one machine communicate layer n on other machine through rules known as layer-n protocol
 - layer 1 is physical medium through which actual communication takes place
 - Data passed from upper layer to lower layer through interface
 - Unmanageable task divided into small manageable task
 - Divide and Conquer Approach  |  Modularity  |  Easy to Modify and Test

 Component :-
  Service   : Set of action that layer provides to higher layer
  Protocol  : Set of Rules(Concern about content and message order) that layer uses to exchange information with entity 
  Interface : It is way through which message transferred from one layer to another layer
 



OSI(Open System Interconnection) :-
 - Developed by ISO(International Organization for Standardization) in 1984 considered architectural model ICC
 - Provide Reference for sending and receiving data with other device using network functionality
 - If client and server on same machine, will managed by OS (Inter-Process Communication)
 - So in Computer network must be client and server both machine required physically separated
 - Each layer is self-contained so that task assigned to each layer performed independently
 - OSI model acts as reference model and not implemented on Internet because of its late invention
 - Model being used is TCP/IP model


 OSI model divided into 7 layers :-
  Physical --> Data Link --> Network --> Transport --> Session --> Presentation -->  Application
        Hardware Layer (1,2,3)          Heart of OSI           Software Layer(5,6,7)
                                   Sender -->   <-- Receiver
    Responsibility of Network(1,2,3)                         Responsibility of Host(4,5,6,7)


 Functionality :-
  Error Control - Receiver receive same message or not
  Flow Control  - Amount of data we send
  CheckPoint    - Downloading data at some point of time we need to add check point (Resume Downloading)
  Multiplexing / Demultiplexing :- Process that run on machine identify which process send data or receive data
  Encryption | Decryption | Cryptographic
 
 


 Physical Layer(Layer 1) :-
  - Lowest layer responsible for physical connection between device
  - Contain information in the form of bits
  - Responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to another node
  - It establish, maintains and deactivates physical connection
  - When receiving data this layer get signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s send them to Data Link layer
  Device :- Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cable
  

  Functionality :-
   Signal - Type of signal used for transmitting the information
   Transmission mode   - Data flow between device in form of Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex
   Physical Topologies - Specifies way in which different devices/nodes are arranged in network
   Bit Synchronization - Using clock, controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at bit level
   Bit rate control    - Define transmission rate(Number of bits sent per second)




 Data-Link Layer(Layer 2) :-
  - Responsible for node-to-node error-free transfer of data-frames
  - Packet in Data Link layer is referred to as Frame(format of data on network)
  - Data Link layer is handled by NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines
  Device :- Switch & Bridges
  
  Data-Link Layer SubLayer :-
   Logical Link Control(LLC) :-
    - When packet arrives in network it responsibility to transmit it to Host using its MAC address
    - Packet received from Network layer divided into frames depending on frame size of NIC(Network Interface Card)   
    - Encapsulate Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in header
    - Receiver’s MAC address obtained by placing ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) 
    - It request on wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and destination host will reply with its MAC address
  
    Media Access Control(MAC) :-
     - link between Logical Link Control layer and network's physical layer 
     - Used for transferring packet over network
  

  Functionality :-
   Framing :- 
    - Transmit raw-bits stram into packet using bit patterns
    - Layer add Header and trailer to the stream
    - Header contain hardware destination and source address
    Diagram :-  [ Header  |  Packet()  |  Trailer ]

   Physical Addressing - After creating frame add MAC address(Physical) of sender and receiver in header of each frame
   
   Flow Control   - Constant Data rate must be maintain on both sides
   Error Control  - Detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames using CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check)
   Access Control - Single communication channel shared by multiple devices MAC sub-layer determine which device has
                    control over channel at given time
    

 

 Network Layer(Layer 3) :-
  - Transmission data from one host to other located in different networks
  - Manages device addressing tracks location of devices on network
  - Responsible for routing and forwarding the packets
  - Support Packet routing(Select shortest path from available routes)
  - Sender & receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header
  - Segment in Network layer is referred as Packet
  - Protocol used to route network are IP, IPv4 and IPv6
  Device :- Router
  
  Functionality :-
   InterNetworking :- Provide logical connection between different devices
   Addressing :- Sender & receive IP address placed in Header by network layer to Identify device uniquely on network
   Routing    :- Layer Protocols determine best route path out of multiple path form source to destination 
   Packetizing:- Receive packet from upper layer and convert into packet which achieve by IP protocol 




 Transport Layer(Layer 4) :-
  - Responsible for End to End Delivery of message in the order which they are sent and no duplication of data
  - Receive Data from upper layer and convert into smaller units known as Segments
  - Provide acknowledgement of successful data transmission and re-transmits data if error found
  - Transport layer operated by OS using system call
  - It termed as end-to-end layer as it provides point-to-point connection between source and destination

  Sender-Side :-
   - Receive formatted data from upper layers perform Segmentation and implement Flow & Error control 
   - Add Source and Destination port number in its header and forward segmented data to Network Layer
   - Sender needs to know port number associated with receiver’s(Destination) application
  
  Receiver-Side :-
   - Read port number from its header and forward received Data to respective application
   - Perform sequencing and reassembling of segmented data


  Functionality :-
   Service Point Addressing :-
    - Specifying Service Point or Port address in header makes sure that message delivered to correct process
   
   Segmentation and Reassembly -
    - Accept message from (session) layer breaks into smaller units and identifies segments using sequence number
    - Each segments produced has header associated with it
    - Message arrived at destination station than reassembles message based on their sequence number
   
   Connection- Control :-
    Connection-less :-  Phase --> Data Transfer
     - Receiver not acknowledge receipt of packet
     - Much faster and more reliable than connection-oriented
     - All Packet travel in different route to reach destination  

    Connection-Oriented :- 
     Phase :- Connection Establish --> Data Transfer --> Termination / Disconnection
     - Receiving device send acknowledgement back to source after packet or group of packets is received 
     - Reliable and Secure
     - All Packet travel in single route to reach destination  

   Flow Control  :- Performed end-to-end flow control rather than across single link
   Error Control :- Ensure that message reach at destination without any error




 Session Layer(Layer 5) :-
  - Establishment connection, maintenance of session, authentication and ensures security
  - Session, Presentation and Application layer are integrated as single layer in TCP/IP model as “Application Layer”
  - Implementation of these 3 layers is done by network application itself

  Functionality :-
   Session establishment, maintenance and termination :- Allow Process to do
   Dialog Control  :- Allow two systems communication with each other in half-duplex or full-duplex
   Synchronization :- Allow process to add check-Point helps to identify error and data loss so it is avoid(Recovery)



 
 Presentation Layer(Layer 6) :-
  - Data from application layer extracted and manipulated as per required format to transmit over network
  - Convert data from one presentation format to another format so known as Translation / Syntax layer
  
  Functionality :-
   Translation :- 
    - Convert data from sender-dependent format into common format and common format into receiver-dependent
      format at receiving end (ASCII to EBCDIC)
   
   Encryption / Decryption :- 
    - Translates data into another form or code 
    - Encrypted data known as ciphertext and decrypted data known as plain text 
    - Key value used for encrypting as well as decrypting data
   
   Compression : Reduces number of bits that need to be transmitted on network
 



 Application Layer(Layer 7) :-
  - Very top of OSI Model which implemented by network application
  - These applications produce data which transferred over network
  - Layer serves as window for application services to access network and for displaying received information to user
  - Application Layer is also called Desktop Layer

TCP/IP Model :-
 - Designed and developed by Department of Defense (DoD) in 1960s and based on standard protocols 
 - First layer is Process layer on the behalf of sender and Network Access layer on the behalf of receiver
 - First four layers that provide physical standards, network interface, internetworking and transport function that
   correspond to first four layers of OSI are represented in TCP/IP model by single layer called application layer
 - TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol means upper-layer protocol is supported by two or more lower-level protocol

  Data-Link Layer
  
  Physical Layer  



 Network Access Layer :-
  - lowest layer of TCP/IP model
  - Combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of OSI model define how data sent physically through network
  - Hardware addressing and protocols present in this layer allows for physical transmission of data
  - ARP is protocol of Internet layer but there conflict about declaring it as protocol of Internet or Network layer
  - It described as residing in layer 3 being encapsulated by layer 2 protocols
  Protocol :- Ethernet, Token-Ring, FDDI, X.25, Frame relay



 Internet Layer :- 
  - Second layer of TCP/IP Known as Network layer
  - Responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network
  - Send packet from any network and they arrive at destination ir-respective of route they take
  
  Protocol used :-
   IP(Internet Protocol) :-
    - Delivering packets from source host to destination host by looking at IP addresses in packet headers 

    Types :- IPv4 and IPv6 
     - IPv4 most of websites are using currently 
     - But IPv6 is growing as number of IPv4 addresses are limited in number when compared to number of Users

    Functionality :-
     IP Addressing :- Used by internet and higher layers to identify device and provide internetwork routing
     Host-to-host communication :- Specify path through which data is to be transmitted
     Data Encapsulation and Formatting :- 
      - Accept data from transport layer protocol and ensures that data is sent and received securely
      - Encapsulates data into message known as IP datagram

     Fragmentation and Reassembly :- 
      - Limit imposed on size of IP datagram by data link layer protocol is known as Maximum Transmission unit(MTU) 
      - If size of IP datagram is greater than MTU unit then protocol split datagram into smaller units so that they 
        travel over local network 
      - Fragmentation done by sender or intermediate router 
      - Receiver side all fragments are reassembled to form an original message

     Routing :- 
      - When IP datagram sent over local network it is known as direct delivery 
      - When on distant network then IP datagram is sent indirectly This can be accomplished by routing


   ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) :-
    - Responsible for report problem not correct them
    - Encapsulated within IP datagrams and responsible for providing hosts with information about network problem
    - Datagram travel from router-to-router until its reach its destination
    - If router unable to route data because some unusual condition then ICMP inform sender that datagram undeliverable
    ICMP Test  :- Test whether destination is reachable or not
    ICMP Reply :- Check whether destination device is responding or not


   ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) :-
    - Find phyical address of host from known IP address 
    ARP Request :- When sender know phyical address of device, it broadcast ARP request to network
    ARP Reply   :- Device connected in network accept ARP Request and process it but only recipient recognize
                   ip address and send back in form of ARP Reply
                 - Recipient add physical address both to its cache memory and to the datagram header      
    ARP Types   :- Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, Gratuitous ARP and Inverse ARP



 Transport Layer :- 
  - Responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data 
  - It shield upper-layer applications from complexities of data
  
  Protocol that used :- 
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) :-
    - Provide reliable and error-free communication between end system
    - Create virtual circuit between sender and receiver and it is active during transmission
    - Realiable it detect error and retransmit damaged frame
    - At Sending end, divide whole message into smaller segment with sequence of number which reordering frame original
    - At Receiving end, Collect all segments and Reorder them based on sequence number
    - Very effective protocol but lot of overhead due which leads to increased cost
   


   User Datagram Protocol (UDP) :-
    - Provide Connection-less, end-to-end delivery of transmission
    - go-to protocol if application not require reliable transport as it is very cost-effective 
    - Unreliable protocol as it discover error but not specify error or which packet lost its id, Contain checksum only 
    - Discovers error and ICMP protocol report error to the sender that user datagram has been damaged
  
    UDP Fields :-
     Source port address      : Address of application program that created message
     Destination port address : Address of application program that receive message
     Total length : Total number of bytes of user datagram in bytes
