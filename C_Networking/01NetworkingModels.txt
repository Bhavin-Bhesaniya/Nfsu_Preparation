OSI and TCP/IP Model :-
 - Set of layers and protocols is known as network architecture

Layerd Architecture :-
 - Networking concept divided into several layer and each layer assigned particular task
 - Data passed from upper layer to lower layer through interface
 - Lower layer add its services to higher layer to provide full set of service to manage communication
 - Layers are Independent so modification in one layer not affect other layer
 - layer n in one machine communicate layer n on other machine through rules known as layer-n protocol
 - layer 1 physical medium through which actual communication takes place

 Component :-
  Service   : Set of action that layer provide to higher layer
  Protocol  : Set of Rules(Concern about content and message order) that layer use to exchange information with entity 
  Interface : Message transferred from one layer to another layer
 


OSI(Open System Interconnection) :-
 - Developed by ISO(International Organization for Standardization) in 1984
 - Provide Reference for sending and receiving data with other device using network functionality
 - If client and server on same machine, will managed by OS (Inter-Process Communication)
 - OSI act as reference model but not implemented on Internet because its late invention, Model used is TCP/IP model

 OSI model divided into 7 layers :-
  Physical --> Data Link --> Network --> Transport --> Session --> Presentation -->  Application
        Hardware Layer (1,2,3)          Heart of OSI           Software Layer(5,6,7)

  - Establish, Maintain and Deactivate physical connection
  - Receiver receiving data into signal than convert it into 0s and 1s to send on Data Link layer
  Device :- Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cable
  
  Functionality :-
   Signal              - Transmitting information either analog or digital signal
   Transmission mode   - Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex
   Physical Topology   - Different devices/nodes arranged in network
   Bit Synchronization - Using clock, control at both side for providing synchronization at bit level
   Bit Rate Control    - Transmission rate(Number of bits sent per second)


 Data-Link Layer(Layer 2) :-
  - Node-to-node  error-free Data-Frames transfer
  - Packet in Data Link layer referred as Frame(format of data on network)
  - Handled by NIC (Network Interface Card) and Device Driver of host machine
  Device :- Switch & Bridge
  
  Data-Link Layer SubLayer :-
   Logical Link Control(LLC) :-
    - When packet arrives in network transmit it to Host using its MAC address
    - Packet received from Network layer divided into frames depending upon frame size of NIC(Network Interface Card)   
    - Encapsulate Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in header
    - Receiver’s MAC address obtained by placing ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) 
    - Request on wire “Who has that IP address?” and destination host reply with its MAC address
  
    Media Access Control(MAC) :- link between LLC and physical layer for transferring packet over network
  

  Functionality :-
   Framing :- 
    - Transmit raw-bits stream into packet using bit pattern and add Header and trailer to stream
    - Header contain destination address and trailer contain sender address
    Diagram :-  [ Header  |  Packet()  |  Trailer ]

   Physical Addressing - After creating frame add MAC address(Physical) of sender and receiver in header of each frame
   
   Flow Control   - Constant Data rate must maintain on both side
   Error Control  - Detect and retransmit damaged or lost frame using CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check)
   Access Control - Single communication channel shared by multiple devices MAC sub-layer determine which device has
                    control over channel at given time

    Connection-less :- Data Transfer
     - Receiver not send acknowledge receipt of packet
     - Faster and more reliable than connection-oriented
     - All Packet travel in different route to reach destination  

    Connection-Oriented :- Connection Establish --> Data Transfer --> Termination / Disconnection
     - Receiving device send acknowledgement back to source after packet or group of packet received 
     - Reliable and Secure 
     - All Packet travel in single route to reach destination  

   Flow Control  :- Performed end-to-end flow control rather than across single link
   Error Control :- Ensure that message reach at destination without any error


 Session Layer(Layer 5) :-
