Definition :-
 - Practice of using network or remote server hosted on internet to store, manage and process data
   rather than local server or personal computer
 
 On-Premise :-                      Cloud Provider :-
  - Own Server                       - Someone else own server           
  - Hire IT People                   - Someone else Hire IT People
  - Pay or rent real-estate          - Someone else pay or rent real-estate
  - Take all risks                   - You are responsible for configuring cloud services and code



Cloud Computing Evolution :-
 Dedicated Server :- 
  - One Physical Machine dedicated to single business that Run single website/webapp 
  - Very Expensive | High Security | High Maintenance
  Diagram :-  People  -->  Server -->  Web app

 Virtual Private Server(VPS) :-
  - One machine dedicated to single business which virtuallized into sub-machines to Runs multiple webapp
  - Better Resources Utilization
  Diagram :-  People  -->  Server -->  Web app(N)

 Shared Hosting :- 
  - One Physical machine shared by Hundred of Business
  - Very Cheap | Limited Functionality | Poor Isolation (Go Daddy)
  Diagram :-  People(N) --> Server -->  Web app(N)

 Cloud Hosting :-
  - Multiple physical machines acts as one system that provide multiple cloud services
  - Flexible | Scalable | Secure | Cost-Efficient | High-Configurability

Evolution of Computing Type :-
 Dedicated :- 
  - Utilized by single Customer
  - Required to guess capacity otherwise overpay for unutilized server and diffcult to replace
  - Can't vertical scale, need manual Migration
  - limited by Host OS
  - Multiple apps result in conflit in Resource sharing
  - Gurantee of security | Fully utility of underlying Resource
  
  Diagram :-
    Wasted Space -> App1, AppN -> Host Operation  (Physical Server)

 
 VMs(Virtual Machine) :-
  - Multiple virtual machine on one machine
  - Hypervisor let you run VMs
  - Physical server shared by multiple Customer
  - Pay for Fraction of server
  - Overpay for underutilized virtual machine and limited by Guest OS
  - Multiple apps on single virtual machine lead conflit in Resource sharing
  - Easy for import and export images for Migration | vertical and horizonalty scale

    Guest OS          Guest OS         Guest OS
        VM            VM               VM
                      Hypervisor
                  
                  Host Operating System


 Containers :-
  - VM running multiple container using Docker Deamon(Software Layer)
  - Resizable so maximum Utilized of Availabel capacity which more cost-effective
  - Share underlying OS so container more Efficient than multiple VMs
  - Not cause conflit

     VM         VM          VM
            Hypervisor     
            HostOS

 
 Functions :-
  - Manage VM running container known as Serverless computer
  - Upload piece of code, choose amount of memory and duration
  - Very Cost-effective | Vm run only when code executed
  - Cold Start(Bit slow) side effect



Types of Cloud Computing :-
 Saas(Software As A Service) :- 
  - Run and managed by Service provider | Designed for Customer | Not worry how maintained
  Ex :- Gmail | Office 365
 
 Paas(Platform As A Service) :-

Types of Deployment Model :-
 Public Cloud  :- Everything built on CSP also known as Cloud-Native and Cloud first
 Private Cloud :- Everything built on Company Datacenter also known as On-Premise(Open stack)
 Hybrid Cloud  :- Using both On-premise and CSP 
 Cross Cloud(Multi-cloud) :- Amazon EKS -->  Azure ARC -->  GCP Kubernate Engine | Anthose(GCP)

 Deployment Method :-
  Cloud-Based :- 
   - Design, build, Run and migrate application in cloud
   - Create app consisting Virtual Server, Database and Networking Component that fully based on Cloud
   Ex :- Squarespace | Dropbox

  On-Premises(Private cloud deployment) :-
   - Deploy Resources by using virtualization and Resource Management Tools

  Hybrid :-
   - Integrate Cloud-based Resource with legacy IT Application
   - Government regulations require business to keep certain records on premises
   - Use some service from cloud and kept most data in on-premises
   Ex :- Deloitte | CIBC
