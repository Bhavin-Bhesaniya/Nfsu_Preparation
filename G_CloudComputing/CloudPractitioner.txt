Evolutions of Cloud Computing :-
 Dedicated Server :-
  - One Physical Machine dedicated to single business
  - Run single website/webapp 
  - Very Expensive, High Security and High Maintenance

 Virtual Private Server(VPS) :-
  - One physical machine dedicated to single business
  - Physical machine is virtuallized into sub-machines to Runs multiple website/webapp
  - Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources

 Shared Hosting :- 
  - One Physical machine shared by Hundred of Business
  - Relise on most teants under-utilizing their Resources
  - Very Cheap, Limited Functionality, Poor Isolation
  - Go Daddy

 Cloud Hosting :-
  - Multiple physical machines acts as one system
  - System is abstracted into multiple cloud services
  - Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-Efficient, High-Configurability
