   rather than local server or personal computer
 
 On-Premise :-                      Cloud Provider :-
  - Own Server                       - Someone else own server           
  - Hire IT People                   - Someone else Hire IT People
  - Pay or rent real-estate          - Someone else pay or rent real-estate
  - Take all risks                   - You are responsible for configuring cloud services and code



Evolutions of Cloud Computing :-
 Dedicated Server :-
  - One Physical Machine dedicated to single business
  - Run single website/webapp 
  - Very Expensive, High Security and High Maintenance
  Diagram :-     People  -->  Server -->  Web app

 Virtual Private Server(VPS) :-
  - One physical machine dedicated to single business
  - Physical machine is virtuallized into sub-machines to Runs multiple website/webapp
  - Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources

 Shared Hosting :- 
  - One Physical machine shared by Hundred of Business
  - Very Cheap, Limited Functionality, Poor Isolation (Go Daddy)
  Diagram :- People(N) --> Server -->  Web app(N)

 Cloud Hosting :-
  - Multiple physical machines acts as one system
  - System is abstracted into multiple cloud services
  - Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-Efficient, High-Configurability
