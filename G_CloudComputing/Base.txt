Lec - 1 
 Introduction :-
  - Cloud Computing Virtualization-based technology Refer to manipulating, Configuring and Accessing application 
    via internet
  - It is something that present at remote location
  - Provide On-demand access and Shared Pool of configurable resources(As per Requirment)
  

 Operation :-
  - Developing and Analysis application 
  - Storage, Backup and Recovery data
  - Streaming video and audio 


 Structure :-  
    Cloud Provider 
       Cloud        --->  Request/Response  <-- Cloud User-N(Mobile, Desktop, Laptop)
    Facility :- 
      PAAS(Platform As Service)
      SAAS(Software as Service)
      IAAS(Infrastructure as Service)    



Lec - 2
 Different Working Model :-
  1) Deployment Model :- Define type of access to the Cloud
   Type :- 
    Public    :- 
     - Service are accessible for general public               
     - Less fee or Free available
     
     Advantages :-
      - Realibility(Access easily) | Flexibility | Location Independent  | High Scalability | Utiliy Based Cost

     Disadvantage :-
      - Low Secure | Less Customizable

      
    Private :- 
     - Service are accessible for only particular Organization 
     - It can be managed by third-party also
     
     Advantages :-
      - High Security and Privacy
      - More Customizable and Control
      - Cost and Engery Efficient
    
     Disadvantage :-
      - Restricted area operations
      - High Priceing
      - Scalability limited


    Hybrid    :- 
     - Combination of both Public + Private 
     - Critical service private and non-critical activity public 

     Advantages   :- Scalability | Flexibility | Security | Cost efficient
     Disadvantage :- Network Issuce because Complexity | Security Compilances | Dependency on Infrastructure


    Community :- 
     - More than one organization created common cloud to access its Services
     Advantages   :- Low cost than Private | Sharing resources among organizations | More secure than Public 
     Disadvantage :- Data Storage | Responsiblity

  
  2) Services Model :- Reference models on which cloud computing is based
   Type :-
    SAAS :- How can access application on cloud | Email, CRM                         | Use software application
    PAAS :- Provide tools to create application | Database, Server, Deployment       | Provide runtime environment    
    IAAS :- Provide platform to create application | Virtual machine, Storage device | Provide Fundamental resources



Lec - 3
 Advantages :-
  - Access, Manipulation and Configuration application over network
  - No Software installation required
  - On-demand self service
  - Cost-Efficient
  - More Reliable
  - Efficient Load Balancing

 Disadvantage / Risk :-
  - Who access data (Snopping)
  - Security method
  - Where will be data stored

 Limitations :-
  - Service availability
  - Data Lock-In(Shifting large volume data)
  - Data Segregation(Data Isolation of each User)
  - Scaling Resource(User requires suddenly)
  - Recovery and Backup

 Components of cloud Infrastructure :-
  - Frontend Interface for end-user
  - Network resources Management
  - Storage for virtual machine
  - Constant storage tools for virtual machine
  - Monitoring tools



Lec - 4
 Characteristic :-
  - On-demand Self-Service
  - Broad Network Access
  - Resource Pooling 
  - Scalability
  - Measure Service
  - Service Oriented
  - Virtualization



Lec - 5 :- Public Cloud Model in Lec-2
