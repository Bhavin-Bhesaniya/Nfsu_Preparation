Introduction to cloud computing :-
 - On-demand delivery of IT Resources over internet based on Virtualization with pay-as-you-go Priceing  

 Operation :-
  - Developing and Analysis application 
  - Storage, Backup and Recovery data
  - Streaming video and audio 

 Structure :- Cloud Provider  -->  Request/Response  <--  Cloud User-N(Mobile, Desktop, Laptop)
 
 Benefits :-
  Agility     :- Quickly spin up resource as you need | Easy access broad range of technology
  Elasticity  :- Scale resource up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as business change
  Cost Saving :- Only pay for IT as you consume it(Variable expense)
  Deploy globally in minutes :-  Put apps in closer proximity to end user, reduce latency and improve experience
  No Software installation required  |  Efficient Load Balancing
 
 Disadvantage / Risk :- Who access data (Snopping) | Security method | Where data stored
 

 Limitations :-
  - Service availability | Data Lock-In(Shifting large volume data)
  - Data Segregation(Data Isolation of each User)

 Component of Cloud Infrastructure :-
  - Frontend Interface for end-user
  - Network resources Management
  - Storage for virtual machine
  - Constant storage tools for virtual machine
  - Monitoring tools



Types of cloud :- 
 - Define type of access to the Cloud

 Public :- Service accessible for general public | Less fee or Free available
  Advantages   :- Realibility(Easy Access) | Location Independent  | High Scalability | Utiliy Based Cost
  Disadvantage :- Low Secure | Less Customizable

      
 Private :- Only particular Organization | Also managed by third-party
  Advantages   :- High Security and Privacy | Customizable  | Cost and Engery Efficient
  Disadvantage :- Restricted area operation | High Priceing | Limited Scalability


 Hybrid :- Combination of Public + Private | Critical service private and non-critical activity public 
  Advantages   :- Scalability | Flexibility | Security | Cost efficient
  Disadvantage :- Network Issuce because Complexity | Security Compilances | Dependency on Infrastructure


 Community :- More than one organization created common cloud to access its Services
  Advantages   :- Low cost than Private | Sharing resources among organizations | More secure than Public 
  Disadvantage :- Data Storage | Responsiblity

  

Types of Cloud computing (Deployment Service Model):- 
 IAAS :- 
  - Basic building blocks for cloud IT
  - Provide platform to create application 
  - Provide Fundamental resources such as Virtual machine, Storage device
  - Highest Flexibility that similar to existing IT resource


 PAAS :- 
  - Provide runtime environment and tools to create application such as Database, Server, Deployment
  - Use Underlying Infrastructure so Focus more on deployment and management of application
  - Don't need to worry about resource


 SAAS :- 
  - Access product that already developed by Service provider such as Email, CRM 
  - Don't need to think about how service and Infrastructure maintain only need to think is how to use



Deployment Method :-
 Cloud-Based :- 
  - Design, build, Run and migrate application in cloud
  - Create app consisting Virtual Server, Database and Networking Component that fully based on Cloud
  Ex :- Squarespace | Dropbox

 On-Premises(Private cloud deployment) :-
  - Deploy Resources by using virtualization and Resource Management Tools
  - Not provide benefits of cloud but ability to provide dedicated resource

 Hybrid :-
  - Integrate Cloud-based Resource with legacy IT Application
  - Government regulations require business to keep certain records on premises
  - Use some service from cloud and kept most data in on-premises
  Ex :- Deloitte | CIBC
