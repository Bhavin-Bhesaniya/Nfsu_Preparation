AWS Amplify :-
 - Provide Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying and hosting single page web application or static
   sites with serverless backend
 - Determine build settings for both front-end and any serverless backend resources configured with Amplify 
   CLI and automatically deploys updates with every code commit

Steps :-
 npx create-react-app amplifyapp
 cd amplifyapp
 npm start
 
 git init
 git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git
 git add .
 git commit -m “initial commit”
 git push origin master

 Select AWS Amplify :-
  Get Started - > Deploy -> Select Github -> Accept Default build setting -> Save and Deploy

 Change in code -> 
  git add .
  git commit -m “changes for v2”
  git push origin master



Module-2 :- Initalize local Amplify app
 Amplify CLI :- 
  - Allow to create, manage and remove AWS service directly from terminal
  - Unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app
  Syntax :- npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli   | -g for global

 Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) :- 
  - Enables to manage users and user permissions in AWST
  - CLI uses IAM to create and manage services programmatically on your behalf via CLI
  
  To configure :- amplify configure
  
  Initalize App :- backend Enviroment(Amplify Studio)
   - Visual Development for building full-stack apps
   - Follow local step instruction :- amplify pull --appId dq7pc88ic5cyk --envName staging
   - Amplify console to view app


  Add Authentication :-
   Amplify libraries - Allow to interact with AWS services from web or mobile application
   Authentication - Process of verifying and managing identity of user using authentication service or API
   
   Install amplify libraries :- 
    - npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
    aws-amplify library   :- Contain all client-side APIs for interacting with various AWS services 
    @aws-amplify/ui-react :- library contains framework-specific UI component

   Create auth service :- amplify add auth | add default setting
   Deploy auth service :- amplify push --y
   
   Configur react project with amplify resources :- 
    - CLI created and continue to update file called aws-exports.js located in src directory of our project
    To configure our app with these resources, open src/index.js  :-
      import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
      import config from './aws-exports';
      Amplify.configure(config);

   Add Authentication flow in App.js :-
    withAuthenticator component  :-
     - Scaffold out entire user authentication flow allowing users to sign up, sign in, reset their password
       and confirm sign in for multifactor authentication(MFA)
    AmplifySignOut component :- Render Sign Out button
   
   Run app locally :- npm run start

   Set up CI/CD of frontend and backend :-
    - Configure Amplify build process to add backend as part of continuous deployment workflow  
    Syntax :- amplify console
    - Choose App settings > Build settings and modify it to add backend section(lines 2-7) to amplify.yml
