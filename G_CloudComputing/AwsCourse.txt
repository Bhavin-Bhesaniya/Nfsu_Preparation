Module - 1
 - On-Demand delivery of IT Resources over internet with Pay-as-you-go Pricing known as Cloud Computing
 
 Deployment Method :-
  Cloud-Based :- 
   - Design, build, Run and migrate application in cloud
   - Create app consisting Virtual Server, Database and Networking Component that fully based on Cloud
   Ex :- Squarespace | Dropbox

  On-Premises(Private cloud deployment) :-
   - Deploy Resources by using virtualization and Resource Management Tools

  Hybrid :-
   - Integrate Cloud-based Resource with legacy IT Application
   - Government regulations require business to keep certain records on premises
   - Use some service from cloud and kept most data in on-premises
   Ex :- Deloitte | CIBC


 Benefits :-
  - Upfront expense(Own server) and Variable expense(Pay-as-use instead of investing on heavily data center)  
  - Stop spending money to run and maintain data center(Focus more on application rather than server maintain)
  - Stop guessing capacity(With EC2 pay only scale-in means pay only for server compute) 
  - Benefits from massive economies of scale
  - Increase speed and agility(flexibility - Access new Resource within minutes)
  - Go global within minutes(Access application within low latency)



Module - 2
 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC-2) handle Virtual server computing 
 - Hypervisor responsible for sharing Underlying physical Resource between virtual machines
 - Multitenancy :- Sharing Underlying hardware between virtual machines
 - One EC2 instance not aware of other EC2 instance on same host
 - EC2 Vertically Scalling(Resizeable) - Provide more cpu and memory to instance based on requirement
 - Handle Network Request to which user accessible or not
 - EC2 works on Compute as Service(Caas) model
 - Pay only for compute time you use when instance is running, not when stopped or terminated


 EC2 configuration :-
  Launch :- Select Basic Configuration(OS, Server, Application) and Specific instance type(Hardware config)
  Connect :- Connect instance by logging and accessing computer desktop
  Use :- After connect run command to install software, storage and organize files  
 
 
 EC2 Instance type :-
  - Each instance type grouped under instance family that optimized for certain task
  General purpose   :- 
   - Balanced Resource use for web server and code repositories
   - If application not require optimization in any single resource area
  
  Compute Optimized :- 
   - For intensive tasks such as gaming server, High performance computing(HPC), Scientific
   - Use for batch processing workloads that require processing many transaction in single group

  Memory Optimized  :- 
   - Fast performance for workloads that Process large datasets in memory
   - Hold data and instructions(Hold Before loading into cpu) that require CPU 
   - Run workloads with High memory for great performance

  Storage Optimized :-
   - Design for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage
   - Suitable for storage optimize instance include distributed system, OLTP, Data warehousing application
   - Input/Output operation per second(IOPS) metric measure performance of storage device

  Accelerated Computing :- 
   - Floating point number calculation, Graphic Processing, data pattern matching
   - Hardware accelerators or co-processors helps data processing for graphic application, game streaming
