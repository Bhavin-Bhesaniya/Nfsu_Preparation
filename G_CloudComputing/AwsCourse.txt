Module - 1
 - On-Demand delivery of IT Resources over internet with Pay-as-you-go Pricing known as Cloud Computing
 
 Deployment Method :-
  Cloud-Based :- 
   - Design, build, Run and migrate application in cloud
   - Create app consisting Virtual Server, Database and Networking Component that fully based on Cloud
   Ex :- Squarespace | Dropbox

  On-Premises(Private cloud deployment) :-
   - Deploy Resources by using virtualization and Resource Management Tools

  Hybrid :-
   - Integrate Cloud-based Resource with legacy IT Application
   - Government regulations require business to keep certain records on premises
   - Use some service from cloud and kept most data in on-premises
   Ex :- Deloitte | CIBC


 Benefits :-
  - Upfront expense(Own server) and Variable expense(Pay-as-use instead of investing on heavily data center)  
  - Stop spending money to run and maintain data center(Focus more on application rather than server maintain)
  - Stop guessing capacity(With EC2 pay only scale-in means pay only for server compute) 
  - Benefits from massive economies of scale
  - Increase speed and agility(flexibility - Access new Resource within minutes)
  - Go global within minutes(Access application within low latency)



Module - 2
 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC-2) handle Virtual server computing 
 - Hypervisor responsible for sharing Underlying physical Resource between virtual machines
 - Multitenancy :- Sharing Underlying hardware between virtual machines
 - One EC2 instance not aware of other EC2 instance on same host
 - EC2 Vertically Scalling(Resizeable) - Provide more cpu and memory to instance based on requirement
 - Handle Network Request to which user accessible or not
 - EC2 works on Compute as Service(Caas) model
 - Pay only for when instance running(Compute Time) Not when stopped or terminated


 EC2 Configuration :-
  Launch  :- Select Basic Configuration(OS, Server, Application) and Specific instance type(Hardware config)
  Connect :- Connect instance by logging and accessing computer desktop
  Use     :- After connect run command to install software, storage and organize files  
 
 
 EC2 Instance type :-
  - Each instance type grouped under instance family that optimized for certain task
  
  General purpose :- 
   - Balanced Resource use for web server and code repositories
   - Use If application not require optimization in any single resource area
  
  Compute Optimized :- 
   - For intensive tasks such as gaming server, High performance computing(HPC), Scientific
   - Use for batch processing workloads that require processing many transaction in single group

  Memory Optimized  :- 
   - Process large dataset in memory for Fast performance
   - Hold data and instructions(Hold Before loading into cpu) that require CPU 
   - Run workloads with High memory for great performance

  Storage Optimized :-
   - Design for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large dataset on local storage
   - Suitable for optimize storage instance include distributed system, OLTP, Data warehousing application
   - Input/Output operation per second(IOPS) metric measure performance of storage device

  Accelerated Computing :- 
   - Floating point number calculation, Graphic Processing, Data pattern matching
   - Hardware accelerators or co-processors helps data processing for graphic application, game streaming

 
 EC2 Pricing :-
  - AWS Cost Explorer enable to visualize, understand and manage AWS Cost and usage overtime
  - Also provide recommandation for savings Plan based on previous usage

  ON-Demand :- 
   - Ideal for short-term, irregular workload that cannot be interrupted
   - No Upfront costs or minimum contracts only
   - Only pay compute time you use
   - Use for developing, testing and running application that have unpredictable pattern
   - Not for long workload

  EC2 Saving Plan :-
   - Reduce compute costs by committing to consistent amount of compute usage for 1-year or 3-year term  
   - Saving upto 66% over on Demand-cost
   - Any usage beyond commitment charged at regular On-Demand rates
  
  Reserved Instance :-
   - Applied billing discount to use of On-Demand Instances in your account
   Charged On-Demand rates until :- 
    - Terminate Instance
    - Purchase new Reserved Instance that match instance attribute(instance type, Region, tenancy and platform)

  Spot Instance :-
   - Ideal for workloads with flexible start and end time or that can withstand interruption
   - Use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand price
   - If capacity no longer available or demand for Spot Instances increases, your instance may be interrupted

  Dedicated Host :-
   - Use Physical fully dedicated server with Amazon EC2 instance capacity | Most Expensive
   - Use existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to help maintain license compliance
   
  
  EC2 Vs Spot :-
   EC2  :- Consist amount of usage over 1 to 3 year | Reduce cost upto 72% over on-demand costs
   Spot :- Workload with Flexible start and End | Reduce upto 90% costs over On-Demand 
           Not require commitment for Consist amount of usage
