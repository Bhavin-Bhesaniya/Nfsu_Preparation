Lec-2 :- Database Basic Intro
 Database System :- 1) Database 2) DBMS
 
  1)Database :- Collection Of related data
    Structure Database    :- Store data in particular shape or structure like table format EX:- RDBMS
    Unstructured Database :- Information that is not arranged according to a pre-set data model or schema Ex :- Text, Multi-media

  2)DBMS :- Collection Of different database operations which perform easily on database Ex :- SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL



    
Lec-3 :- File System vs DBMS
 - File system user When single user of that particular system Store and *-manage data
 - Due to client-server architecture we need DBMS

 Reason :- 
  - Searching
  - Efficient Memory Utilization
  - No required attribute(METADATA) in DBMS rather than File system 
  - Concurrency (Multiple People Access at same time) 
  - Security(RollBased Access Control)
  - Data Redundancy(Constraint)




Lec-4 :- DBMS Architecture 2 Tier VS 3 Tier
 2-Tier Architecture :-
  Client (Interface :- API(JDBC,ODBC))   <----->     Database Server(Process User Query)
   - Easy Maintain
   - No Scalability
   - Security not proper maintain(Vulnerability - Due to client direct access with database)
   - Query Performance 

 3-Tier Architecture :-
  Client (Interface :- API(JDBC,ODBC))   <----->  Business Layer(Application Server)  <-----> Database Server(Process User Query)
   - Security
   - Scalability
   - No Load Database because business layer ask proper data only 




Lec-5 :- What is Schema
 - Logical Representation of database(Diagramatically or OnPaper) (Student Table)
 - To implement in real life we use SQL DDL(Data Defination Language) Command
