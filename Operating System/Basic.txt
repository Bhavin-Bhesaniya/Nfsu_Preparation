Operating System Defination :-
 - An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user
   of a computer and the computer hardware. 
 - provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work. 
Diagram :-
  User -> Application Program -> Operating System -> Computer Hardware

Functionalities :-
 1.Resource Management 
 2.Process Management 
 3.Storage Management
 4.Memory Management 
 5.Security/Privacy Management :-  Windows uses Kerberos authentication
 6.I/O System Management :– 
 
- module that keeps track of the status of devices is called the I/O traffic controller. 


Assembler :– 
 - The input to an assembler is an assembly language program. 
 - Program this computer by writing a series of ones and Zeros(Machine language), place them into the memory of the machine. 


Compiler :– 
 - The High-level languages processed by compilers and interpreters. 
 - A compiler is a program that accepts a source program in a “high-level language “and produces a corresponding object program. 
 - An interpreter is a program that appears to execute a source program as if it was machine language. 

Loader :– 
 - Loader must load, relocate and link the object program that places programs into memory and prepares them for execution. 
 - There are various loading schemes: absolute, relocating, and direct-linking. 


History of Operating system :– 

 Generation  Year	Electronic device used	Types of OS Device
 First	     1945-55	Vacuum Tubes	  	Plug Boards
 Second	     1955-65	Transistors		Batch Systems
 Third	     1965-80	Integrated Circuits(IC)	Multiprogramming
 Fourth	     Since 1980	LargeScale IntegrationPC
  

Types of Operating System :– 

 1.Batch Os 	         - [ATLAS, Manchester Univ., late 1950s – early 1960s] 
 2.Time-sharing OS  
 3.Distributed OS   
 4.Network OS 	    
 5.Real-time OS     
 
 Other :-
 - ATLAS (Manchester Univ., late 1950s – early 1960s) [First Os]
 - Single process operating system    [MS DOS, 1981]
 - Multiprogramming operating system  [THE, Dijkstra, early 1960s]
   - increases CPU utilization by keeping multiple jobs (code and data) in the memory so that the CPU always has one to execute
 - Multitasking operating system      [CTSS, MIT, early 1960s]  
   - a logical extension of multiprogramming CPU executes multiple tasks by switching among them

Types of Operating System :– 

1)Batch Operating System :-
 - Not interact with the computer directly
 - Operator responsibility to sort jobs with similar needs. 

  Advantages :-
  - Processors of the batch systems know how long the job would be when it is in queue
  - Multiple users can share the batch systems
  - Time is very less
  - Easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems
 
  Disadvantages of Batch Operating System :-  
  - The computer operators should be well known with batch systems
  - Batch systems are hard to debug
  - It is sometimes costly
  - The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails
 
  Examples :-  Payroll System, Bank Statements,

2) Time-Sharing Operating Systems :– 
 - Each task is given some time to execute so that all the tasks work smoothly.
