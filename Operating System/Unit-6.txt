Disk Scheduling :-

Hard-Disk Architecture :-
 Platter (Circle Shape)  :
   - Every Platter has two surfaces upper-level and lower-level
   - On Platter surface there is read-write head which are connected through actuator arm to use fetch and read data
   - Read-Write head movement either in forward or backward only 
   - On Platter surface there are tracks 
   - Every track has fix no. of sectors where we put our data 

   Formula DiskSize : P x S x T x S x D
 
 Spindal(Vertical Stick) : Connect Platter to move either in clock-wise or anti-clock-wise undirectional



Disk Access Time :-
 Seek Time        :- Time taken by R/W head to reach desired track
 Rotation Time    :- Time taken by one full rotation(360)
 Rotation Latency :- Time taken to reach desired track(Half of Rotation Time)
 Transfer Time    :- Data To be transfer/ Transfer rate;
                     Transfer rate(Data Rate) = {No. of Heads x Capacity of one track x No. of rotation in onse second }
