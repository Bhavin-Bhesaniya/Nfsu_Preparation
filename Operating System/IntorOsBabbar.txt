Unit - 1 

 What is Computer and Other Defination?
  Computer :- General purpose device that execute sequences of instruction to perform numerical calculations and other tasks. 
  Computer Science  :- Study of computer systems and computer processes
  Computer hardware :- Collection of all physical elements of computer system 
  Computer software :- Collection of all program stored in computer system and executed by computer system

  Software             :- Collection of computer programs, libraries and related data are referred to as a software
  Application Software :- Perform task for user 
  System software      :- Operate and controls computer system and provide platform to run application software
  Computer program     :- Collection of instructions that performs specific task when executed by computer. 
  
  Algorithm   :- Computer program that performs well-defined task 
  Kernel      :- Part of OS which interacts directly with hardware and performs most crucial tasks
  Microkernel :- Support only core operating system functionalities
  Shell       :- known as command interpreter which is part of OS that receives commands from users and gets them executed 



 What is OS?
  - An OS is a piece of software that manages all resources of a computer system, both hardware and software 
    and provides an environment in which user can execute his/her programs in convenient and efficient manner.
  - OS is program that acts as interface between user and computer hardware and controls execution of all kinds of programs
  - First OS is ATLAS developed by Manchester University in late 1950s and early 1960s based on batch operating systems

 OS Structures type :-  
  From :- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-approaches-or-structures-of-operating-systems/#:~:text=Layered%20structure%3A&text=In%20this%20structure%20the%20OS,the%20lower%20level%20layers%20only.
  
    - Monolithic    [MS DOS, Unix, Linux] 
      - Architecture where entire operating system is working in kernel space. 
      - Entire operating system executes with maximum privileges.
      - https://static.javatpoint.com/operating-system/images/monolithic-structure-of-operating-system.png

    - Layered       
      - OS is broken into number of layers (levels).
      - The bottom layer (layer 0) is the hardware and the topmost layer (layer N) is the user interface
      - These layers are so designed that each layer uses the functions of the lower level layers only.
      - Main disadvantage of this structure is that at each layer, data needs to be modified and pass on which adds overhead to system.
      - Unix example
    
    - Microkernel   
      - Designs operating system by removing all non-essential components from kernel and implementing them as system and user programs. 
      - This result in a smaller kernel called the micro-kernel. 
      - All new services need to be added to user space and does not require the kernel to be modified
      - Thus it is more secure and reliable as if a service fails then rest of the operating system remains untouched. 
      - MacOs example

    - Modular 



 Os Duties / Function / Services :- 
   - Provide environment for programs to execute process or service
   - It provide user service to execute programs in a convenient manner 

   Process Management / Process Execution :-
    - Creating and deleting user and system processes 
    - Suspending and resuming processes 
    - Load program into memory, execute it and Handle it
    - Provide mechanism for process synchronization, Interprocess communication and deadlock handling 
    
   I/O Operation / I/O Management / Device Management :-
    - OS Manages device communication via their respective drivers between User and Device Driver
    - Keeps tracks of all devices 
    - Program that responsible for this task is known as I/O controller.

   Storage/File management or Manipulation:-
    - Organization of files into directories for easy navigation and usage 
    - File system operations like Creating, deleting and manipulating files and directories based on permission mode
    - Mass storage management like Free space management, Storage allocation and Disk scheduling 

   Memory management :-
    - Keeping track of which part of memory is being used by which job 
    - Allocating and deallocating memory space 
    - Management of Primary Memory or Main Memory
    - Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word or byte has its own address and directly accessible by CPU
    - Program must execute in main memory(RAM)
    
   Resource Management :-
    - OS manages all kinds of resources using schedulers
    - CPU scheduling algorithms are used for better utilization of CPU.

   Communication :-
    - Multiple processes communicate with one another through communication lines in the network.
    - OS handles routing and connection strategies, and problems of contention and security.
    - Both processes can be on one computer or on different computers, but are connected through a computer network
    - Communication may be implemented by two methods, either by Shared Memory or by Message Passing.
    
   Error Handling / Error detection :-
    - Error may occur in CPU, in I/O devices or in memory hardware. 
    - OS constantly checks for possible errors and takes appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing    
    
   Protection / Security :-
    - Protection refers to mechanism or way to control access of programs, processes, or users to resources defined by computer system.
    - OS ensures that all access to system resources is controlled
    - Ensures that external I/O devices are protected from invalid access attempts.
    - Authentication features for each user by means of passwords.
   
   Control Over System Performance :-
    - Recording delays between request for service and response from system 
  


 Types of operating systems â€“ 
    Single process operating system    [MS DOS, 1981] 
    Multiprogramming operating system  [THE, Dijkstra, early 1960s] 
    Multitasking operating system      [CTSS, MIT, early 1960s] 


   Batch Operating System / Batch Processing :-
    - Not interact with computer directly 
    - OS define job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit.
    - Jobs are processed in the order of submission, i.e., first come first served fashion
    - There is an operator which takes similar jobs having same requirement and group them into batches.
    - When job completes its execution, its memory is released and output job gets copied into output device for later processing.
    - Lack of interaction between user and job.
    - Difficult to provide desired priorit
     
    Example :-
      User ---> Set Job in ROM device ---> Go to operator ---> Operator group similar job and execute 
      ---> One time one process execute (No particular time for output) ---> Output is write to disk and get to user from operator
      ---> User use output in own system and process output 
     
    Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/batch_processing.jpg


   Time-Sharing operating system :-
    - Sharing of processor time among multiple processes
    - Each task is given some time to execute so that all the tasks work smoothly.
    - OS uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time.
    - Switching of job on CPU is so fast we feel that one process is executing continuously
    - Quick Response Time so Reduce CPU Idle Time(If one process not running its move job to another process)
    - Security of program and data and its fast switching so problem of data communication and its reliability 

    Example :-
     3 Process need to execute ---> Share processor time among them (Share is based on scheduling) 
     

   Distributed Operating System :-
     - Use multiple central processors to serve multiple real-time applications and multiple users.
     - processors communicate with one another through various communication lines like network connection
     - These are referred as loosely coupled systems also
     - processors are referred as sites, nodes, computers, and so on.
     - With resource sharing facility, a user at one site may be able to use the resources available at another.
     - Reduction of delays in processing and loading on host computer
     - OS distributes computation logics among several physical processors
     - processors do not share memory or a clock. Instead, each processor has its own local memory, storage etc...
     - If these processors connect with local network (Single network) like single server it is called cluster operating system
     - Main advantage is availability, if any system faile another load balancing that system, Scalability     


   Network Operating System :-
    - Runs on server computer and provides server capability to manage data, application, user and other networking functionality
    - Purpose to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, 
      typically local area network (LAN), private network or to other networks.
    - Centeralized Server so security managed and software upgrade easily and enable remote access 
    - Dependency on central server and high cost also required regular maintenance and update


   Real Time operating System :-
    - Real-time operating system (RTOS) has well-defined and fixed time constraints which have to be met or the system will fail. 
    - Defined as data processing system in which time interval required to process and respond to inputs is so small that 
      it controls environment.   
    - Time taken by system to respond to input and display required updated information is termed as response time.
    - Time constraint matter lot and can't be delays
    
    Example :- embedded systems, robotics, scientific utilities, etc.
    
    Types :-
      Hard-Real Time System :-
       - Critical tasks complete on time there no place for delays 

      Soft-Real Time System :-
       - Less restrictive with limited utility than hard-real time system


   Embedded Systems :-
    - Work on fixed machine like a.c.
    - You can't customally change its functionality 
 


 OS Processing Type :-

   Multiprogramming :-
    - Multiprogramming increases CPU utilization by keeping multiple jobs (code and data) in memory so that CPU always has one to execute
    - OS keeps several jobs in memory at time and pick one jobs from its job pull
    - It is non pre-emptive means if we give one process from ram to cpu, cpu will complete that entire process only after complete
      one process pick another process
    - Sometime cpu will go for I/O operation at that time cpu will pick up another process from job pull So cpu idel time is zero   
    - High efficient cpu utilization and user feels many programs run simultaneously
    - Cpu scheduling is required
    Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/memory_layout.jpg


   Multitasking / Time-Sharing :-
    - Multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming also known as Time-sharing systems
    - CPU executes multiple tasks by switching among them. 
    - It is pre-emptive means we already give process particular time after than automatically move to second process but
      first process still available if not complete in within given time
    - When a process executes, it typically executes for only very short time before it either finishes or needs to perform I/O.
    - I/O Process slow so During this time, a CPU can be utilized by another process.
    - Response time should be minimal and it's required scheduling 
    Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/multitasking.jpg   


   Spooling(Simultaneous Pheripheral Operations Online) :- 
    - Different Pheripheral devices(I/O Device) can run simultaneously 
    - Provide buffer area in secondary memory which is accessible to I/O devices.
    - It save CPU time and user not need to wait for I/O process
     
    Example :- User enter input in I/O --> I/O store in either main memory or secondary memory if cpu is not free -->
               When cpu free take these process from disk to cpu and after processing update in same disk -->
               Now these disk display process output 
      
    Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/spooling.jpg
 


 What is SystemCall :-
  - If we need to use any system functionality we need to go in kernel mode because we only can access user mode
  - To go in kernel mode we use system call   
  - System call is mechanism using which user program request kernel to access system functionality 
  - User programs typically do not have permission to perform operations like accessing I/O devices and communicating other programs. 
  - User program invokes system calls when it requires such services like print output on monitor use printf library 
  - System calls provide an interface between program and operating system. 
    
   Type of System Call :- 
    E.x. :- fork, exec, getpid, getppid, wait, exit. 
    File related(Open, read, write), device related(Hardware)(Print something), Information(Process related)(Display time or other), 
    Process Control(load, abort in main memory) Fork --> Process create its child process,
    Communication(Inter-Process communication)(Pipe, shmget, create/delete connection)
    Security(chmod, umask)

 
  Dual-mode operation :-
    - User mode 
    - Kernel mode / supervisor mode / system mode / privileged mode 
    Mode bitâ€“ 0: kernel, 1: user 
    Request using a system call



 What is Booting :-
  - Booting is the process of starting computer and loading kernel.
  - When a computer power is turned on Then cpu will move to BIOS(basic input output system) in ROM 
  - BIOS run process power-on self-tests (POST) which check all hardware
  - On successful of POST bios load MBR(Master Boot Record) to RAM
  - Now MBR load bootstrap loader to RAM
  - bootstrap loader loads OS, Kernel or more sophisticated loader to RAM
  Types :- 
    Hard Booting - Power On system
    Soft Booting - Restart / Ctrl + Alt + Del twice



Unit - 2 :-

 What is process creation :- 
  - Process creation is one process which creating another process
  - Processes are called parent process and child process respectively
  - Each process has unique id
  - Process may obtain resources either from its parent or from operating system directly
  - Parent process continues executing with its children process and wait for them to finish
  - Process may be duplicate of its parent process(Same code or data) or may have new program loaded into it
  - Typically kernal is first process to be created or said to be root of process tree
  - Zoombie process is process that has terminated but its still exists in PCB because its parent has not yet accpted its return value


 
 What is process termination :-
  - Process termination marks deletation of PCB process
  - A parent process may be terminated child process :-
    - If it has exceeded its resource usage
    - If its results is no more needed
    - If parent process is terminating and operating system doesn't allow an orphan process



 What is Process :-
  - Process is program execution which defined as an entity which represents basic unit of work to be implemented in system
  - Program is passive entity while procrss is active entity
  - When we compare program with process, process is a dynamic instance of a computer program. 
  - When program loaded into memory it become process, it can be divided into four section :-
    Stack : Contain temporary data such as method/function parameters, return address and local variables
    Heap  : Dynamically allocated memory to a process during its run time
    Text  : Includes current activity represented by value of Program Counter and contents of processor's registers.
    Data  : Contain global and static variable
    Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/process_components.jpg
  


 What is Process State :-
  - Process state defined current activity process as process executes its state changes
  - Only one process can be in running state at any instant
  - Each process is internally represented by Process Control Block(PCB) also called Task Control Block
    
  State :-
   New   :- Initial state when process is first started/created in secondary memory
   Ready :- Process come from secondary memory to main memory(RAM)(Queue) when we start process execution
            Here process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
            Long-term scheduler bring these process from Rom to RAM 
   Running :- Short-term scheduler assign process to processor from ready state and CPU execute process instructions.
              Sometime transfer process to ready state when high-priority process is given by ready state 
              or process exceeded time limit/ time quantum(Round-Robin)
              If process request is I/O request it is transfer to waiting state
   Waiting   :- Process move into these state if it needs to wait for resource, such as waiting for user input or I/O operation
                After complete process its moves into ready state not running 
   Terminate :- Once process finishes its execution, or it is terminated by OS and deallocating all resources 
   Diagram   :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/process_state.jpg


 
 What is PCB(Process Control Block) :-  
  - PCB is data structure maintained by Operating System for every process
  - It is identified by an ID(Process ID/PID) 
  - PCB maintained process throughout its lifetime
    PCB Contain All information of process :-
     - Process ID
     - Process Privileges : Required to allow/disallow access to system resources
     - Process State 
     - Pointer            : To parent process
     - Program Counter    : Pointer to the address of next instruction to be executed for this process.
     - CPU Register       : Where process need to be stored for execution for running state
     - CPU scheduling information    : Process priority, other scheduling information, etc. 
     - Memory Management Information 
     - Accounting information        : Includes amount of CPU used for process execution, time limits, execution ID 
     - I/O status information        : List of I/O devices allocated to process.
  


 What is Process scheduling :-
  - OS maintenance all PCBs in Process Scheduling queues which used to perform process scheduling
    
  OS maintenance following important process scheduling queues :-
    Job Queue     - As process enter system it is put in job queue which keeps all processes in system 
    Ready Queue   - Processes that are residing in memory and are ready for execution are kept in ready queue
                  - It is implemented as linked list of PCBs with header containing pointers to first and last PCBs.
    Device Queue  - List of processes waiting for particular I/O device is called a device queue. 
                  - Each device has its own device queue. 
    Diagram :- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/queuing_diagram.jpg


  Types of Schedulers :-
   - Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways.
    
   Long-term Scheduler(Job Scheduler) :-
    - When process changes state from new to ready, then there is use of long-term scheduler.
    - Select processes from those submitted by user and loads them into memory for execution
    - It is done by using multiprogramming which represented by number of processes in memory  
    - Long-term scheduler select proper mix of CPU-bound processes and i/o-bound processes. 
    - Multitasking OS like unix and windows not use long-term scheduler they put all new processes in the memory for short-term scheduler
    - Ready Queue handle process queue


   Short-term scheduler(CPU Scheduler) :- 
    - Selects process from ready state(Ready Queue) and allocate CPU to one of them.
    - It is invoked frequently and very fast than long-term scheduler
    - Here Dispatcher which take decision of which process to execute next.  
    - Gives control(PCB information) to cpu to process processes which is selected by CPU scheduler known as Dispatcher
    - CPU Scheduler is invoked when process switches from running state to waiting state OR terminates
    - MS DOS does not support multiprogramming hence no cpu scheduling


   Medium-term scheduler(Swapping):- 
    - Medium-term scheduler invoked due to waiting state is full and need to move process in suspended state
    - Removes processes from memory or suspended it when waiting state(device queue) full due to lots of I/O request 
    - We move process from device queue to secondary memory it is called swapping
    - Remove process from memory and make space for other processes and suspended process moves to secondary storage its called Swapping
    - After complete I/O operation process will be join waiting state if there is space in waiting state otherwie wait for some time


  Types of Scheduling :-
    Non-Preemptive scheduling / cooperating scheduling :-
    - Process keeps in cpu until it terminates(Complete) 
    - Some machine support is :-  Windows 3.1X

    Preemptive scheduling :- 
     - Process can be forced to leave cpu and switch to ready queue due to high-priority process or time quantum
     - Ex :- Unix, Linux, Windows 95 or Higher   


  Scheduling Criteria :-
    â†‘ CPU utilization  - Percentage 
    â†‘ Throughput       - Number of processes completed per unit time 
    â†“ Turnaround time  - Time from submission to completion (time spent in different queues + time spent in CPU 
                                                               + time spent in different i/o devices) 
    â†“ Waiting time     - Time spent in ready queue (only) 
    â†“ Response time    - Time from submission to first response    



 What is Context Switching :-       
  - Context switching is to store and restore context of CPU in PCB so that process execution can be resumed from same point at later time. 
  - It is essential part of multitasking operating system features which enables multiple processes to share single CPU. 
  - When scheduler switche CPU from executing one process to execute another, state of current running process is stored into PCB 
  - After this state, process next run in own loaded PCB and used set of PC, registers, etc. 
    At that point second process can start executing.
  - To avoid the amount of context switching time, some hardware systems allow two or more sets of processor registers
  - When process is switched following information is stored :-
     - Program Counter
     - Scheduling information
     - Base and limit register value
     - Currently used register
     - Changed State
     - I/O State information
     - Accounting information

 
 
 Inter-Process communication :-
  - Reason
    - Information sharing
    - Computational Speedup
    - Modularity 
    - Convenience
  - Models
    - Shared Memory
    - Message Passing [Send(p, message) and Receive(id, message)]  



 Scheduling Algorithm :-
  - Gantt Chart(Henry Gantt)  Use to sloveing numerical calculation
  - Used to select process for execution 
  - These algorithms either Pre-emptive or Non-Preemptive
  - Non-Preemptive select one process and complete it where pre-emptive select process but in some cases also select other process


  First-Come First-Served(FCFS) Scheduling :-
   - Non-Preemptive
   - High Average Waiting Time
   - Convoy Effect - Several small processes may need to wait if large process is give the cpu   
   - Poor performance and average waiting time is high
   
   Criteria :- Arrival Time : Check Who Come First Use in Gantt Chart

   Example :-
    Process No. | Arrival Time | Burst Time(Execution Time) |Complete Time | TAT(Turnaround Time) | WT(Wait Time) | Response time(RT) 
      p1             0                2                            2              2                     0             0
      p2             1                2                            4              3                     1             1  
      p3             5                3                            8              3                     0             0
      p4             6                4                           12              6                     2             2

    Gantt  :-  p1(0) | p2(2) |  CPU IDle(4) | p3(8) | p4(12)  # Starting 0 + execution time 

    Turnaround Time :- Complete Time   - Arrival Time
    Waiting Time    :- Turnaround Time - Burst Time
    Response time   :- Time at first cpu got first time - Arrival time
    Average Turnaround Time :- 2 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 14/4 = 3.5
    Average Waiting Time    :- 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 3/4  = 0.75 


  Shortest-Job-First(SJF) Scheduling :-
   - Process with smallest burst time is selected
   - FCFS to break ties
   - Optimal but cannot be implemented
   - Non-Preemptive

            - If two process not have same Arrival Time but already in queue check burst time
            - When both burst time same check arrival time if arrival time same check lower process ID

    Turnaround Time :- Complete Time   - Arrival Time
    Waiting Time    :- Turnaround Time - Burst Time
    Response time   :- Time at first cpu got first time - Arrival time
    Average Turnaround Time :- 5 + 8 + 2 + 10 = 25/4 = 6.25
    Average Waiting Time    :- 2 + 4 + 0 + 6 = 12/4  = 3

           - Starting from 0 and check lower arrival time with 1 execution time
           - If any other lower process arrive and which burst time is lower than previous process 
             add it in cpu otherwise continues old process
           - Add last execution time as completion time

    Turnaround Time :- Complete Time   - Arrival Time
    Waiting Time    :- Turnaround Time - Burst Time
    Response time   :- Cpu First time - Arrival time
    Average Turnaround Time :- 24/4 = 6 
    Average Waiting Time    :- 11/4 = 2.75 
 

  
  Priority Scheduling :-
   
   Pre-emptive Priority Scheduling :-
    -    
    Criteria :- Priority Use in Gantt Chart

    Example :-
    Priority Process No ArrivalTime  Burst Time(Execution Time)  Complete Time  TAT(Turnaround Time)  WT(Wait Time)  Response time(RT) 
    10           p1            0                5                       12             12                     7             0
    20           p2            1                4                        8              7                     3             0

          - Higher no higher priority 
          - If two process in ready queue and same arrival time so we need to check priority
          - We process higher priority process here
          - If 2 process have same priority and same arrival time use process id sequence

    Turnaround Time :- Complete Time   - Arrival Time
    Waiting Time    :- Turnaround Time - Burst Time
    Response time   :- Cpu First time - Arrival time
    Average Turnaround Time :- 22/4 = 5.5 
    Average Waiting Time    :- 10/4 = 2.5 



  Round-Robin Scheduling :-
   - When process in ready queue then we select it and move in cpu(Running Queue)
   - In RR Scheduling cpu use time quantam and within then time if finish terminate process otherwise send back in running state
   - Here maintenance required on ready queue also 

   Criteria :- Time Quantam Use in Gantt Chart

   Example :-
    Process No. | Arrival Time | Burst Time(Execution Time) |Complete Time | TAT(Turnaround Time) | WT(Wait Time) | Response time(RT) 
      p1             0                5                           12             12                     7             0
      p2             1                4                           11             10                     6             1  
      p3             2                2                            6              4                     2             2
      p4             4                1                            9              5                     0             4

    Give Time Quantam :- 2 
    Ready Queue :- | p1 | p2 | p3 | p1 | p4 | p2 | p1
      Cpu       :- 0    2    

    Gantt       :- | p1 -3 | p2 -2 | p3 0 | p1 -1 | p4 0 | p2 0 | p1 0|
      Cpu       :- 0       2       4      6       8      9     11    12
          
    - How many time context switches happern :- Not calculate first and last cpu time | :- ANs : 6

    Turnaround Time :- Complete Time   - Arrival Time
    Waiting Time    :- Turnaround Time - Burst Time
    Response time   :- Cpu First time - Arrival time
    Average Turnaround Time :- 29/4 = 7.25 
    Average Waiting Time    :- 15/4 = 3.75   

 
  
  Multi-level Queue Scheduling :-
   - In real life when we have multiple processes so why single ready queue is used
   - There will be different queues must be for ever process
   - Every process will be have it own algorithms
   - (StarVashion)If too much higher priority process arise than lower level process not executed at time multi-level queue feedback use
   Inter-Queue Scheduling :- Preemptive priority scheduling or RR(80% time for foreground processes and 20% time for background processes)
   
   Diagram :- 
     Highest Priority ---> System Process  --> Round-Robin  ------|
                                                                  |
     Medium Priority  ---> Interactive Process ---> SJF   ------[ CPU ]      
                                                                  |  
     Lowest Priority  ---> Batch Process  -->       FCFS  ------|



  Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduline :-
   - Lowest priority process give feedback and it slowely slowely update and execute
   - It use for lower priority process



 What is Thread :-
  - Thread is smallest sequences of instructions that can be managed independently by scheduler
  - Thread is component of process
  - Multiple Thread can exists within same process, executing concurrently and share resources such as memory
  - Threads of process share its instructions(Executable Code ) and its context(value of its variable at given any moment)

  Difference between Process and Thread :-
   - processes are typically independent while threads exist as parts of a process
   - processes carry considerably more state information than threads
   - multiple threads within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources 
   - processes have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space
   - processes interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms
   - context switching between threads in same process is typically faster than context switching between processes

  Advantages of Multi-Thread Programming :-
    - responsiveness 
    - faster execution 
    - better resource utilization 
    - easy communication 
    - parallelization
