1)Computer Defination ?
 - A computer is basically a programmable machine capable to perform arithmetic and logical operations automatically and sequentially. 
 - It is also known as a data processor, as it can store, process, and retrieve data as per the wish of the user.
 - "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.
 - It is believed that the Analytical Engine was the first computer which was invented by Charles Babbage in 1837. 
 - It used punch cards as read-only memory. Charles Babbage is also known as the father of the computer.

 Basic Part Of Computer :
  - Processor		: executes instructions from software and hardware
  - Memory			: data transfer between the CPU and storage.
  - Motherboard     : A part which connect all other component of computer
  - Storage Device  : Permanently stores the data
  - Input Device	: allows you to communicate with the computer or to input data
  - Output Device   : enables you to see the output 

 Type :
  Micro Computer	 :  single-user, 8-bit microprocessor chips, PDA(Personal Digital Assistant), laptop
  Mini Computer      :  support multiple users simultaneously, used by small organization
  Mainframe Computer :  supporting thousands of users simultaneously, used by large firms and goverment organization
  Super Computer     :  task-specific and used for specialized applications such as large-scale numerical problems in scientific
  Workstations       :  like personal computer, it has a more powerful microprocessor and a higher-quality monitor than a microcomputer
 
 Features :- 
 - Automation 
 - Speed
 - Storage
 - Accuracy
 - Versatility
 - Diligence

 - Vast memory

 History Of Computer :-

 Abacus : first computer,  said that Chinese invented Abacus around 4,000 years ago.
		- It was a wooden rack which has metal rods with beads mounted on them. 
		- Perform Arithmetic operations

 Napier's Bones : manually-operated calculating device which was invented by John Napier (1550-1617) of Merchiston 
			    -  first machine to use the decimal point.

 Pascaline : invented between 1642 and 1644 by a French mathematician-philosopher Biaise Pascal. 
  		   - It is believed that it was the first mechanical and automatic calculator.

 
 Stepped Reckoner or Leibnitz wheel : by a German mathematician-philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz in 1673.

 Difference Engine : 1820s, it was designed by Charles Babbage
				   - mechanical computer which could perform simple calculations like logarithm tables.

 Analytical Engine : developed by Charles Babbage in 1830
				   - used punch-cards as input


 Generation Of Computer :-

  First : (1946-1959) computers were slow, huge and expensive
		- vacuum tubes were used as the basic components of CPU and memory
		- depended on batch operating system and punch cards
		- Magnetic tape and paper tape were used as output and input devices
