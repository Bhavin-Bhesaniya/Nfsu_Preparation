Intor to Physical Layer :-

 - Last layer from sender side and top layer in receiver side
 - Physical Layer provide functionality to data-link layer
 - When all bits finally come from data-link layer, physical-layer needs to send it using transmission media like guided-unguided media
 - Physical Layer deals with hardware
 - Convert logical data into signal

 Functionality :-
  Cabels and Connectors    - Twisted, Co-axial, Optical Fibers which used to send data on signal | BNC, MGRT, UTP Connectors (Join Cabel)
  Physical Topology        - How to connect physical devices and Configuration? (Star, Mesh, Bus, Point-To-Point) 
  Hardware(Repeaters, Hub) - Increase signal strength | Hub for multipoint connection
  Transmission mode        - Simplex-mode(One way data send), Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex
  Encoding                 - Send data to either analog or digital signal
  Multiplexing/ Demultiplexing - If increase machine on same Channel not need to create new channel use existing using time division 
                                 Send N number of signal to single signal to send | Convert 1 signal to N no. of signal



Topologies :-
 - How devices are connected to each other 

 Mesh :- 
  - Where all devices connect to each other or say support point-to-point communication
    Realibility :- In system if single fails is there any method to send signal or say system works | Highest Realibility
    Cost        :- Dependant of cable quality and quantity | High cost
    Security    :- If a and d communicate other devices(b, c) doesn't no about that
    Disadvantage :-
     - High Maintenance
     - Not support Multi-cast

  - How many wired required :- 
     NC2 Formula :- n(n-1)/2 
     Here n is the number of nodes which represent no. of devices connected
  
  - No. of ports(Connector) :- (N-1) | (N-1) * n = for total devices 



 Star :- Hub(Multi-Port Device)
  - Multi-pal device are connected to each other through Centeralized device called Hub
  - No of cabel same as no of devices :- N
  - No of ports(Connector) :- N | N * N
  - Less Realibility because if hub is fails(Single-Point Failure) entire network fails 
  - Less Cost compared to Mesh
  - Security is also less 
  - Support Point-to-Point



 Bus :-
  - Backbone cabel / Coaxial-cabel / Thick Ethernet wire(Bandwith is high) in which multiple devices are connected through drop line
    using tape which connect Backbone cabel to Drop Line
  - All devices connected on single line called bus topology
  - No of cabel = N + 1 (N : no of devices)
  - No of ports = 1     | 1 * N
  - Single-Point Failure so No Realibility
  - No Security
  - Less Cost compared to Mesh
  - At the end of cabel we can add Terminator or Repeaters(Increase Signal Strength & Join more Backbone Cabel) 
  - Support Multi-Point so Collision is high  


 
 Ring :- 
  - Multipal Bus topology design in ring shape
  - No of cabel = N + 1 (N : no of devices)
  - No of ports = 1     | 1 * N  
  - Less Realibility | No Security | Less Cost compared to Mesh
  - Send Message in Unidirectionally  
  - To remove collision we use Token-Ring



 Hybrid :-



Manchester encoding and differential manchester encoding :-
 - Transmission of data means convert upper layer digital data(0,1 form) to analog or digital signal
 - To encode data digital to digital we use manchester and differential manchester encoding
 - Dr.thomas and IEEE802.3 convention
 Manchester :-
  0 -->  -|_
  1 -->  _|-

 Different Manchester Encoding :-
  0 --> |-|_ , |_|- 
  1 --> -|_  , _|-



Various Device in computer network :-
 Cabel :-
  - To connect various devices which are physically separated
  - Trasfer data through packets or signal form

  Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cabel :- 
   - Transfer data in form of electric signal
   - 10 Base T / 100 Base T
   - 10 means 10 MBPS(Mega Bit Per Second) data can be transfer per second
   - Base has two types :-
      BaseBrand :- At time Only one signal can be transmit if other signal come collision arise
      BroadBand :- Multiple signal can be transmit parallel
   - T means only 100 meter signal can be transmit than attuention occurs(Signal strength week)
   - Use in Ethernet LAN

  Coaxial Cabel :-
   - Transfer data in form of electric signal
   - 10 Base 2 / 10 Base 5
   - Other means same but 2 and 5 means 200 and 500 meter distance

  Fiber Optice :- 
   - Transfer data in form of light Signal
   - Speed of light signal is - 3x10^8
   - 100 Base Fx
   - Fx means fiber channel which cover 2km distance 

  Question :- If N devices connect on network what is maximum collision domain ? --> N
              Cable can filter or not :- If Two Lan connected it can move signal or not
                - Filter means can we decied it can move further or not
                Ans :- Yes, there is no software in cabel



 Repeaters :-
  - Works on physical layer pure hardware
  - Increase strength of weak signal means Regenerates Strength of signal
  - Amplifier also do this but if in starting signal strength is X, if it goes down Amplifier increases it 2x or 4x 
    but if we use repeater strength will be same x -> x 
  - We can increase distance of signal
  - It is 2 port devices, also forwarding signal but not supporting filtering and maximum collision is N



 Hubs :-
  - Pure Hardware device
  - Multi-Point Repeater
  - Hub is dedicated device which give functionality like if any wire has problems occured or power on or off there is small blink light
    which repeater not provided
  - Support forwarding but not supporting filtering so high traffic which become collision domain problem



 Bridges :- 
  - Connect two different LAN's works on physical and data-link layer
  - Support forwarding
  - Bridges can check MAC address means decided that packets send to forward or not
  -
