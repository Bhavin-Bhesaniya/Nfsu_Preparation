Computer Network Type Based On Communication:-
 1)Open System   :- A system which is connected to the network and is ready for communication. 
 2)Closed system :- A system which is not connected to the network and can’t be communicated with
  
Computer Network Defination :-
 - An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media. 
 - include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices 
   such as Router,Wireless Router,Hub,Bridge,Wireless Bridge,Switch.

Network Topology :-
 - The  arrangement of the different devices in a network. 
 - Examples : Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, and Daisy chain, Tree, Point-to-point, Hybrid

OSI :- 
 - Stands for Open Systems Interconnection. 
 - It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer.

Protocol :- 
 - A protocol is the set of rules or algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network and there exists different 
   protocol defined at each layer of the OSI model.
 

# UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS OF NETWORK :-
Host name :- Each device in the network is associated with a unique device name known as Hostname.  

IP Address (Internet Protocol address) :- ipconfig(command) 
 - Also known as the Logical Address, the IP Address is the network address of the system across the network. 
 - To identify each device in the world-wide-web, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns IPV4 address as unique identifier to each 
   device on the Internet. 
 - Length of an IPv4 address is 32-bits, hence, we have 2(32) IP addresses available. 
 - The length of an IPv6 address is 128-bits.

MAC Address (Media Access Control address) :- ipconfig/all
 - Also known as physical address, the MAC Address is the unique identifier of each host and is associated with its NIC (Network Interface Card). 
 - A MAC address is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing. 
 - The length of the MAC address is : 12-nibble/ 6 bytes/ 48 bits

Port :- netstat -a
 - A port can be referred to as a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application. 
 - Any host may have multiple applications running, and each of these applications is identified using the port number on which they are running. 
 - A port number is a 16-bit integer, hence, we have 216 ports available
	Port Types		Range
	Well known Ports	0 – 1023
	Registered Ports	1024 – 49151
	Ephemeral Ports		49152 – 65535

Socket :- The unique combination of IP address and Port number together are termed as Socket. 

DNS Server (Domain Name system) :- nslookup website name
 - DNS is basically a server which translates web addresses or URLs into their corresponding IP addresses.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) :- 
- It is used to convert an IP address to its corresponding physical address(MAC Address). 
- ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the Receiver’s machine. 

RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) :-
- It provides the IP address of the device given a physical address as input. 
- But RARP has become obsolete since the time DHCP has come into the picture.

The Internet And Web :-
 - Internet is a global network comprised of smaller networks that are interconnected using standardized communication protocols. 
 - The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite. 
 - This model divides methods into a layered system of protocols.  

  These layers are :-
  1)Application layer (highest) – concerned with the data(URL, type, etc.). This is where HTTP, HTTPS, etc., comes in. 
  2)Transport layer 			– responsible for end-to-end communication over a network. 
  3)Network layer 				– provides data route. 


The World Wide Web :- 
 - The Web is a only way to access information through the Internet. 
 - It’s a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. 
 - The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML  are interlinked using hypertext links and are accessible via the Internet. 

  To link hypertext to the Internet, we need: 
  - The markup language, i.e., HTML. 
  - The transfer protocol, e.g., HTTP. 
  - Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the address of the resource. 
  - We access the Web using Web browsers. 


Difference between Web and Internet: 
	Internet														Web
 - Network of networks and the network allows to exchange	- Model for sharing information using Internet way to access Information through the Internet
   of the data between two or more computers.           	                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 - A way of transporting information between devices.		- The protocol used by the web is Http.
 															- The Web is accessed by the Web Browser.
															

URL :- 
 - A URL is human-readable text that was designed to replace the IP addresses that computers use to communicate with servers.
 - A URL consists of :-
   Ex : protocol://WebSiteName.topLevelDomain/path
	- Protocol – Http or Https
	- WebSiteName – google or any
	- topLevelDomain- .com, .edu, or any other
	- path- specific folders and/or subfolders that are on a given website. 


Who governing the internet :- 
 - The ultimate authority for where the Internet is going rests with the Internet Society, or ISOC. 
 - ISOC is a voluntary membership organization whose purpose is to promote global information exchange through Internet technology. 
 - ISOC appoints IAB to review and standards and allocate resources like addresses
 - ISOC also meet IETF for discuss operational and technical problems

Internet and Web programming :- 

How does it actually work at a very low level :- Image
 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Internet Of Everything :-
  - IoE is the intelligent connection of people, process, data, and things that will be transforming our world in such a way that 
    there will be billions of connected devices having sensors to detect, measure and access their status all of 
	which will be connected over a public or private network built over standard protocols like TCP/IP

  Difference between iot and ioe :- 
  - IoT is mostly about physical devices and objects communicating with each other(Machine to Machine Communication)
  - but IoE brings with it the network intelligence to bind all these concepts together into a cohesive system.(M2P)(P2P)
 
   IoE Economy will profoundly affect four major Aspects of our lives :-
   1)People :- people will themselves becomes Nodes on the internet
   			- (Ex : fitness band’s which read a person’s vital signs with chips which track the performance of Athletes.) 
   2)Things :- Things and physical items such as sensors also fetching information from its surroundings called the internet of things. 
			-  These devices will be fetching data from their environment internally or externally and sending it back to the server 
			   for analyzing and making much more intelligent decisions.
   3)Data 	:- sending higher level, more processed data back to respective servers for faster evaluation or more intelligent decision making
   4)Process:- the right information will be delivered to the right person at the right time in an appropriate way
