===================================== Question - 2 3 Marks =====================================
1. What is DataMart?
 - Data mart is Subject-oriented relational database that stores transactional data in rows and columns 
 - It is subset of data warehouse because it focused on particular area of data
 - Allow us to quickly access critical insight without wasting searching time through entire DW
 - It contains historical data, which makes it easier for an analyst to determine data trend
 
 Types of data mart :-
  Dependent   : Created from enterprise DW and use it as main source of information
  Independent : Standalone systems that function without DWs extracting information    
  Hybrid      : Combine information from both DW and other operational system
 
 Advantages :-
  - Cost-efficiency
  - Simplified data access
  - Quick access to insight
  - Lower data maintenance
  - Easier and faster implementation
 
 Disadvantage :-
  - Enterprises create too many disparate and unrelated data marts without much benefit which big hurdle to maintain
  - Cannot provide company-wide data analysis as their data set is limited
  



2. Explain Future trends of Data Warehouse?
 - DW collecting and managing data from different source to provide meaningful business insight
 - DW concept origin in 1980s when organizations started building warehousing solution for business data
 - Due to amount of diversity data generated by business require more storage, networking and computing
 - As Organization expand their customer base and embrace new technology amount of enterprise data generated 
   growing exponentially 
 - This is not limited to structured data it also contains unstructured and semi-structured data
 - As we have seen that size of open database has grown approximately double its magnitude in last few years, that 
   shows significant value of data
 - As number of users increases, size of data warehouse also increases
 - With growth of Internet, there is requirement of users to access data online
 - Apart from size planning, it is complex to build and run data warehouse system that are ever increasing in size
 
 Future Trends will be :-
  Evolutions of new data Forms
  DataLakes
  LakeHouse(Combine best elements of DW AND DL)



3. What is Normalization data store?
 - Normalization is the process of removing data redundancy by implementing normalization rules
 - These Normalization rules accomplish by applying on new database design or improving existing database design
 - Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships
 - In Normalization Stages are called Normal Forms
 - There are actually six levels of normal forms
 - In most applications normalization achieves its best in 3rd Normal Form

 Types of Normal forms :- 
  First Normal Form (1NF) :- 
   - Each table cell should contain single and unique value
   - Data stored in tables rows are uniquely identified by primary key

  Second Normal Form (2NF) :-
   - Everything from 1NF 
   - Only data that related to table’s primary key is stored in each table

  Third Normal Form (3NF) :-
   - Everything from 2NF 
   - There are no in-table dependencies between columns in each table



4. Explain DataWareHouse types?             
 - Data warehouse is core of BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting
 - It is large storage of information which design for query and analysis instead of transaction processing
 - Concept of DW first came into 1980 when IBM researchers Paul Murphy and Barry Devlin developed business DW

 Types of Data Warehouses :   
  Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) :-
   - Centralized warehouse which provides decision support service across enterprise
   - It offers unified approach for organizing and representing data
   - Provide ability to classify data according to subject and give access according to those divisions

  Operational Data Store :-
   - In ODS, DW refreshed in real time Means It updated often as transaction system generate new data
   - Used for detailed decision making and operational reporting
   - Serves as conduct for data between operational and analytics system

  Data Mart :-
   - Data mart is subject-oriented relational database that stores transactional data in rows and columns 
   - It is subset of data warehouse because it focused on particular area of data
   - Allow us to quickly access critical insight without wasting searching time through entire DW
   - It contains historical data, which makes it easier for an analyst to determine data trend
   Types of Data mart :- Dependent, Independent, Hybrid
  


5. Explain Advantages and Disadvantage of DataWareHouse? 
 - Process for collecting and managing data from different sources to provide meaningful business insight

 Advantages :- 
  - Stores large amount of historical data which helps to analyze different time periods of data
  - Allow businesses to quickly access critical data from single sources
  - Provide consistent information on various cross-functional activities
  - Supporting ad-hoc query and reporting
  - Helps to integrate many sources of data to reduce stress on production system
  - Reduce total turnaround time for analysis and reporting
   
 Disadvantage :-
  - Not an ideal option for unstructured data
  - Creation and Implementation of Data Warehouse is time confusing affair
  - Difficult to changes in data types and ranges, data source schema, indexes, and queries
  - It is too complex for average users
  - Organisations need to spend lots of their resources for training and Implementation



6. Explain DataWareHouse Today?
 - Today most data warehouse used for business intelligence to enhance CRM and datamining
 - Some are also used for reporting, and some are used for data integration 
  
 Business Intelligence (BI): 
  - BI is process of collection, organization and analysis of data
  - Main purpose of BI activity is to improve business performance But BI is more than that—it 
  - Allows us to better business decision-making by ensuring strategic decisions
  - It store historical information as well as real-time gathered data from source system

 Customer Relationship Management : 
  - Customer is person or organization that consumes our products or services

 Data Mining : 
  - Data mining also known as knowledge discovery in database (KDD) 
  - Process of exploring data to find pattern and relationship between data to predict unknwon or future values of data
  - DM retrieve data from this database to implement various algorithm and logic which result present to end user
  - It is improveing organizational decision-making through insightful data analysis
 
 Customer Data Integration(CDI) : 
  - CDI is the MDM(Master data management) for customer data
  - CDI process of retrieving, cleaning, storing, maintaining, and distributing customer data



7. Difference between OLAP Vs OLTP?
 OLAP :- 
  - OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing
  - Provide data analysis for business decisions
  - Allow users to analyze database information from multiple database systems at one time
  - Primary objective is data analysis not data processing
  Types :- ROLAP, MOLAP, HOLAP(Hybrid)
  Operations :- Roll-up, Drill-Down, Drill-Up, Slice and Dice, Pivot
 
 OLTP
  - Supports transaction-oriented applications in 3-tier architecture
  - Main purpose is to capture and store business transaction
  - OLTP administers day to day transaction of an organization
  - Primary objective is data processing not data analysis 

 DIFFERENCE between OLTP and OLAP :-
  - OLAP is category of software tools that analyze data stored in database whereas OLTP 
    supports transaction-oriented applications in 3-tier architecture
  - OLAP creates single platform for all type of business analysis needs which includes 
    planning, budgeting, forecasting, and analysis 
  - While OLTP is useful to administer day to day transactions of organization
  - OLAP characterized by large no. of data while OLTP Number of short online transactions
  - In OLAP, data warehouse is created uniquely so that it can integrate different data sources
    for building consolidated database whereas OLTP uses traditional DBMS 



8. Explain Data Flow Architecture?
 - Describe How data stores and arranged within data warehouse and how data flows from source systems to users
 - It include how data flows are controlled, logged and monitored as well as it mechanism ensure quality of data 
   in data store
 - Activity that produce data flow architecture is known as data modeling
 
 Types of Data flow architecture :-  
  Single DDS (Dimensional data store)
  NDS + DDS  (Normalized data store)
  ODS + DDS  (Operational data store)
  Federated data warehouse

  DDS :-
   - User-facing data store in form of one or more relational databases 
   - Store data in dimensional format that more suitable for analysis

  NDS :- 
   - Internal master data store in the form of one or more normalized relational databases 
   - Purpose of integrating data from various source systems captured in stage, before data
     is loaded to user-facing data store
    
  ODS :- 
   - Hybrid data store in form of one or more normalized relational databases 
   - It containing transaction data and most recent version of master data 
   - Purpose of supporting operation on application

  Federated :-
   - Practical approach to achieving "single version of truth" across organization 
   - It used to integrate key business measures and dimensions 
   - Foundations of federated are common business model and common staging area



9. Explain DataStore in DataFlow Architecture :-
 - Data store is one or more databases or files containing data warehouse data
 - Data arranged in particular format and involved in data warehouse processes
    
 User-facing data store :- Available to end users and queried by end users and end-user applications 
 Internal data store    :- Used internally by DW components for purpose of integrating, cleansing, logging, preparing 
                           data and it not open for end users
 Hybrid data store      :- Used for both internal data warehouse mechanisms and for query end users    



10. Explain DataLake?
 - Enable organization to store and consume enterprise data to make informed business decision
 - Main purpose is to establish single source of truth inside organization for decision making
 - Data lake is vast pool of raw enterprise data whose consumption patterns or reasons are yet to be defined 
 - It not impose any rigid schema on data ingested from various sources
 - They enable physical and logical separation of data
 - They encourage ‘Schema-On-Read’ policy rather than ‘Schema-On-Write’ policy of traditional data warehouses. 
 - It not provide solution to handle failures that can happen during operations ETL or Stream operations
 - Failure in operation can only be recovered by re-doing entire operation again
 - Updates and merges of data are challenging



===================================== Question - 3 5 Marks =====================================
1. Explain DataWareHouse Architecture? 
 - Process of collecting and managing data from different sources to provide meaningful business insight
 - It involve collecting, cleansing, transforming data from different source and loading them into fact/dimension table
 - It represents subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile structure of data
 
 Main Component of DataWareHouse Architecture :-
  External Data   - Different types of data such as RDBMS, FLAT FILES or any other format
  Stage Area(ETL) - Extract different source data and loading them into staging area, process it and load data into DW
  DataWareHouse   - Store ETL Processed data
  DataMart        - Subset of datawarehouse that store subject-oriented data
  DataMining      - Exploring data to find pattern and relationship between data to predict future values of data

 
 Types of DataWareHouse Architecture :-

 Single-tier Architecture :-
  - Remove data redundancy by minimizing amount of data stored
  - Not frequently used in practice
  - It doesn’t have component that separate analytical and transaction processing
  Diagram :- Different Data Source --> DataWareHouse(ETL Data)  --> Presentation Tools
    
    
 Two-tier Architecture :-
  - Include staging area between data sources and DW
  - By adding staging area it ensure all data loaded into warehouse is cleansed and in appropriate format
  - This approach has certain network limitation and cannot expand it to support large number of users
  Diagram :- Different Data Source --> Staging area(ETL Tools) --> DataWareHouse(ETL Data)  --> Presentation Tools


 Three-tier Architecture :-
  - Mostly used architecture for data warehouse system
  - Essentially, it consists of three tiers:
    Bottom tier :- 
     - Database(RDBMS) for warehouse where cleansed and transformed data is loaded
    
    Middle tier :- 
     - Application layer giving an abstracted view of database
     - Consist of OLAP server for fast querying of data warehouse by implementing ROLAP or MOLAP model
    
    Top-tier  :- 
     - User accesses and interacts with data
     - Contain front-end tools for displaying results provided by OLAP

2.Explain DataWareHouse and its characteristics? Most Imp
 - Process of collecting, managing and cleansing data from different sources to provide meaningful business insight
 - It involve collecting, cleansing, transforming data from different source and loading them into fact/dimension table

 Characteristics of DW:-
 
 1)Subject-oriented :-
  - Provide on topic information rather than ongoing operations of organization
  - Data warehousing process data with specific theme such as sales, distributions, marketing etc.
  - DW never operate only on current operations 
  - It focuses on demonstrating and analysis of data to make various decision
  - Deliver easy and precise information around particular theme by eliminating data which not required make decision


 2)Integrated :-
  - Data from multiple source are integrated in DW
  - Integration means founding shared entity to scale all similar data from different source
  - It must have reliable naming conventions, format and codes
  - Integration benefits in effective analysis of data


 3)Time-Variant :-
  - Data in DW maintained via different intervals of time such as weekly, monthly or annually etc.
  - DW found various time limit between large datasets and OLTP
  - Data in DW is predictable with specific interval of time and deliver information from historical prespective
  - It comprises and eleminate time explicitly or implicitly


 4)Non-Volatile :-
  - As name define data resided in DW is permanent
  - Data is not erased or deleted when new data is inserted
  - It include quantity of data
  - Here Data is read-only and refreshed at particular intervals
  - It beneficial in analysing historical data and comprehension functionality 
  - DW Not need transaction process, these mechanism automatically recapture and concurrency control data
    


3. Explain Structure data, Semi-structured data and Unstructured data
 - Data is set of facts such as descriptions, observations and numbers which used in decision making
 - Big Data include huge volume, high velocity and extensible variety of data
 
 Unstructured data :-
  - Data that does not organize in pre-defined manner or not have pre-defined data model
  - Unstructured information is set of text-heavy but also contain data such number, fact as well
  - To store unstructured data in DW defind attributes for each data item then organize them according attributes
  - We can store unstructured data in Relational database As binary object column with attribute 
  - To Store data in file system just store file pointer in database
  - Each unstructured data has different attribute based on that user easily find particular data 
  - Content of unstructured data itself analyzed, extracted, categorized and stored to assist information retrieval
  Example :- Audio, Video, Image, Email and Binary Data


 Structured data :-
  - Data that has been formatted and transformed into well-defined data model
  - It organized data into formatted repository that is typically database
  - Store all data in SQL database format like rows and columns
  - They have relational keys and easily mapped into pre-designed fields
  - Today Structured data are most processed in development and simple way to manage information
  - It minimize data redundancy
  - It more inter-dependent and less flexible
  Example :- SQL database


 Semi-Structured data :- 
  - Type of data that has some consistent and characteristics
  - Data that not reside in relational database but it has some organizational Property that make it easier to analyze
  - With processes, you store them in relational database but Semi-structured exist to ease space 
  - Organizational property like metadata or semantics tags are used with semi-structured data to make more manageable
  - It still contains some variability and inconsistency
  Example: XML data
