===================================== Question - 2 3 Marks =====================================
1. How to enabling CLR on the SQL Server Instance?
 - Start SQL Server Management Studio
 - In Connect to Server dialog box :-
   Select Database Engine
   Select server name
   Select Windows Authentication --> Click Connect
 - In SQL Server Management Studio toolbar -> Click New Query
   Type following command in SQLQuery pane :-
    sp_configure @configname=clr_enabled, @configvalue=1
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
 - Press F5 to execute this script
 - In Messages pane, observe that Configuration option 'clr' enabled is displayed



2. What is DataMining?
 - Data mining also known as knowledge discovery in database (KDD) 
 - Process of exploring data to find pattern and relationship between data to predict unknwon or future values of data
 - It work with almost everytype of data formats but best work with DW because data in DW already cleaned, structured 
   formate and its also have metadata which describe meaning of data   
 - Datamining retrieve data from this database to implement various algorithm and logic which result present to enduser
 - It is improveing organizational decision-making through insightful data analysis
 - Key ability is to understand why some thing happened in past and to predict what will happen in future
 - If DM used to explain current and past situations its called descriptive analytics
 - When DM used to predict future it is called predictive analytics

 Process :
  - Set business objectives
  - Data preparation
  - Model building and pattern mining
  - Evaluation of results and implementation of knowledge

 Advantages :-
  - Enables organizations to obtain knowledge-based data
  - Cost-efficient
  - Helps decision-making process of an organization
  - Automated discovery of hidden patterns 
  - Prediction trends and behaviors

 Disadvantage :-
  - Organizations may sell useful data of customers to other organizations for money
  - Many data mining analytics software is difficult to operate
  - Selection of right data mining tools is very challenging task
  - Not precise technique so that it may lead to severe consequences in certain conditions



3. What is Data analysis?
 - Provide guidance in business decision-making process by accessing timebased data from multiple sources
 - Henry Morris given term data analysis in 1997 
 - Purpose is to extract useful information from data and taking decision based upon data analysis
 - User use analytic application to access dimensional data warehouse interactively
 - Also use Slice and dice, drilling up and drilling down techniques for data analysis
 - Sliceing is process of retrieving block of data from cube by filtering on one dimension
 - Dicing is process of retrieving block of data from cube by filtering on all dimensions
 - Drilling up means presenting data at higher level on dimension hierarchy
 - Drilling down means presenting data at lower level on dimension hierarchy
 - Using data analysis we can get an overview of current business performance such as sales, production etc.
 - It is more useful for company and organization that make business decisions based on data rather than instincts 

 Types of analysis :-
  Text Analysis     
  Statistical Analysis
  Diagnostic Analysis
  Predictive Analysis
  Prescriptive Analysis 

 - Data analysis process Nothing but gathering information by using proper application or tool which allows you to 
   explore data and find pattern in it
  Process :- 
   Data Requirement Gathering
   Data Collection
   Data Cleaning
   Data Analysis
   Data Interpretation
   Data Visualization 



====================================== Question - 3 5 Marks =====================================
1. Explain Business Intelligence?
 - Business intelligence is collection, methodology, organization and analysis of data
 - Main purpose of BI activity is to improve business performance But BI is more than thatâ€”it 
 - It allows for better business decision-making by ensuring strategic decisions
 - BI application query ODS(Opertional Data Source) and ERP(enterprise resource planning) 
 - BI data typically stored in DW or in smaller data marts that hold subsets of business information 
 - It store historical information as well as real-time gathered data from source system
 - That enabling BI tools to support both strategic and tactical decision-making processes
 - Therefor raw data from different source systems generally must be integrated, consolidated and cleansed using data
   integration and data quality management tools 
 - It ensure that BI teams and business users are analyzing accurate and consistent information
 
 
 BI Processing Step :-
  - Data preparation in which data sets are organized and modeled for analysis
  - Analytical querying on prepared data
  - Distribution of key performance indicators (KPIs) and other finding solution to business users 
  - Use information to take strategic business decision
 

 Classify BI in 6 Categories :-
  Reporting Application :-
   - Used to perform light-weight analysis 
   - Query on DW and present data in static tabluar or pivot format
   
  Analytic Application :-
   - Query DW repeatedly and interactively so present data in flexible format that users can slice and dice 
   - Used to perform deeper-analysis

  DataMining Application :-
   - Explore DW to find patterns and relationships that describe data
   - Used to perform Pattern finding

  Dashboard :-
   - Category of BI Application that gives quick high level summary of business performance in
     graphical gadget, typically chart, graph, indicator and color-coded maps
   - By clicking this gadget we can drill down to lower-level detail

  Alert :-
   - Alert are notifications to users when certain events or conditions happen

  Portal :-
   - Functions as Gateway to access and manage business intelli-gence reports, analytics, mining and dashboard
     applications as well as alert subscription 



2. Explain Deployment Process?
 - In SSIS SQL Server 2012 introduced brand new deployment model for SSIS project deployment
 - This new deployment model called Project deployment model unlike Legacy Deployment model 
   Where each package was single unit of deployment 
 - In new deployment model, Create deployment package containing everything needed for deployment in single file with
   .ispac extension
 - Apart from handling deployment issues, manageing configuration file for each environment for each package was also
   pain in Legacy deployment model
 - New Project deployment model includes Project/Package Parameters, Environment variables and Environment reference


 Deployment Process Steps :- 
  - Create Integration Services Catalog 
  - Create SSIS project with Project Deployment Model 
  - Deploy project to Integration Services Catalog 
  - Create Environments, Environment variables  
  - Set up environment reference in deployed project  
  - Execute deployed project/package using environment for example either for TEST or PROD
  - Analyze operations performed on Integration Services Catalog 
  - Validate deployed project or package  
  - Redeploy project to Integration Services Catalog  
  - Analyze deployed project version and restored to desired one

 - Add Foreach loop container in project
 - Right-Click on Foreach loop container --> Edit 
 - Set enumerator to foreach file enumerator
   In enumerator configuration :-
    - Set folder to "d:\TestPackage\"
    - Set Files to "t1*.dtsx"

 - Click Variable Mappings
 - Select new variable from drop-down list --> Set variable name "packageToRun" --> Click Ok 
 - Drag and Drop Execute Package task into Foreach loop container
 - Click on execute package task and select Edit --> Select Package --> Set Location --> Click ok    
 - Finally configure connection to use variable package name
 - Right-click on connection  --> Select Properties  --> Change name to PackageToRunConnection

  In Expression Builder dialog :-
   - Select Expression  
   - Add new expression 
   - Select ConnectionString
   - Click Expression Editor button 
   - From variable tree drag  @[User::PackageToRun] into Expression Window 
   - Save expression
  
 - Now run package it will execute each package in folder with correct filename
