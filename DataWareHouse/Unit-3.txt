9. What is DataStaging?
 - DataStaging is an intermediate storage area used for data processing during ETL process                     

===================================== Question - 2 3 Marks =====================================
1. Explain Sequence container control?
 - Sequence container in SSIS is useful for grouping tasks together
 - Each flow containing one or more tasks and containers that run within overall package control flow
 - If Sequence container includes more than one task or container, connect them using precedence constraint
 - We consider Sequence container as subset of SSIS package
 - It acts as single control point for the tasks defined inside container
 - Sequence container Grouping tasks so that you can disable part of package that’s no longer needed
 - Managing multiple tasks properties in one location by setting properties in Sequence container
 - Providing scope for variables that work with group related tasks
 - It Follows parent-child relationship with underlying task



2. What is Flat File?
 - Flat file is type of database where collection of records follow uniform data format
 - It was developed and implemented in early 1970s by IBM
 - Database is Flat because every line hold one data input, depending on categorization of column
 - Flat file databases store plain text records and binary files that are needed for a specific purpose
 - In Flat file All records are stored in one place for easy to understand and sort record
 - Most common flat file example :- Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file 
 - First row in database contains keys and fields to identify categorize data
 - Rows represent data points where each row is collection of cells—represents single record
 - Different columns in record use tab or comma to delimit fields
 - Flat file database does not have multiple tables, unlike in relational database
 - Information contained in flat files does not have associated paths or folder
 - Because of flat structure data in flat file cannot be manipulated or analyzed easily without being
   imported into another application



3. Explain SSIS Task?
 - SSIS stands for SQL Server Integration Services
 - It is component that available in Microsoft SQL Server database software
 - Different types of tasks perform different kinds of work
 - SSIS also contains graphical tools and window wizards workflow function 
 - It perform wide range of transformation and integration tasks
   
 Types Of SSIS task :-
  Execute SQL Task     :- Used to execute SQL statement
  Execute Package Task :- Used to call other packages within same project
  Execute Process Task :- Allow us to run application or batch script as SSIS
  Script Task          :- Allow us to write .Net code to perform operations
  FTP Tasks            :- Perform operations on files and folders on server
  File System Task     :- Perform manipulations in file system such as moving files, deleting files, renaming files, 
  Data Flow Task       :- Used to read data from one or multiple data sources, transform data and load data
                          to one or more destinations
  Analysis Services Processing Task :- Used to process objects of SSAS cube or Tabular model



4. Give list of components of Data-Flow task?   
 - DataFlow task encapsulates data flow engine that moves data between sources and destinations
 - DataFlow consists of at least one data flow component but it is typically set of connected data flow component
 - Run time DataFlow task builds execution plan from DataFlow and DataFlow engine 
 - Data Flow task can also include multiple data flows if data copied order is not significant 
 - However Dataflow engine determines order of execution when there are multiple data flows within one Dataflow task

 SSIS Dataflow Component :- 
 - Classified into DataConnection and DataTransformation
  1)DataConnection
    Favorite      :- Find source and destination assistant for creating provider to database table or some file
    Other Sources :- Helps to choose connection provide such as ADO.NET Source, Flat file, OLE DB, ODBC, XML, Excel
    Other Destination :- Data export to OLE DB Destination, SQL Server, ADO.NET, Flat file, Excel

  2)DataTransformation 
    Common :- Find ommonly used tools for data transformation such as data conversion, derived column, etc.
            - OLE DB Command, Multicast Component, Script Component, Merge Join, Uninon all 
    Other Transformation :- Audit, DataMining Query, Pivot, DQS Cleansing, Cache Transform



5. Give basic Steps for creating Package and Run it?
 - Package is collection of connections, control flow elements, data flow elements, event handlers, variables, 
   parameters and configurations
 - That assemble using either graphical design tools that SSIS provides or build programmatically

 Steps to create package :- 
  - Open Visual Studio --> Create New Project 
  - In Project dialog box expand Business Intelligence --> Select Integration Services Project 
  - Change default name to BCA-6 exam
  - Accept Default location or Select Browse to locate folder you want to use --> Click OK
  - By default empty package created with title Package.dtsx and added to your project under SSIS Packages
 
 Run SSIS Package :- 
  - Solution Explorer 
  - Right-click Integration Services project that contains package 
  - Open package that you want to run 
  - Click Start Debugging on menu bar or press F5
  //ADO.NET --> Multicast --> Flat file
  


6. Write Step to insert record into table using For loop container control 
 - In SSIS For-loop is looping implementation of task by which task will evaluate expression and loop process 
   until evaluation becomes False
 - Statements that executed within ForLoop Container are in form of SSIS tasks like Execute SQL Task, Script Task etc.
  
 Step :-
  - Create Integration Services project  
  - Drag and drop For Loop Container 
  - Before processing set 2 variables that will be used in loop process
  - To create variable go to View --> Other windows --> Variable and assign values
  - Double click for loop container it will open container configuration

   Add configuration as below :-
    InitExpression - @Increment = 1
    EvalExpression - @Increment <= @Count     // Here count = 10 so insert same record 10 time
    AssignExpression - @Increment = @Increment + 1
  
   Write code in SQL Server Management Studio :-
    use northwind
    go
    Create table if not exists bhavin(name varchar(20), email varchar(20))
    insert into bhavin values("Youtube", "google@gmail.com")
    Select * from bhavin
  
  - Configure For Loop Container with SQL Server Management Studio
  - Execute Package it will insert 10 record
  - To check Package executed properly or not go to query analyzer



===================================== Question - 3 5 Marks =====================================
1. Explain Control Flow?
 - Control flow define tasks that performing data management operations 
 - It define operation and conditions for task under which they will be executed
 - Exeuction order is defined by how individual tasks are connected to eachother
 - Task that not follow any preceding task as well as tasks that follow same preceding task are executed in parallel
 - SSIS package consists of at least one control flow task and optionally one or more DataFlow
 - To accessed SSIS package we need to Documenting it
 - Documenting Define name for Control task add more about task in Description field or add annotation

 Types of control flow elements :-
  Containers  
   - Provide package structure to task
   - Support repeating control flow tasks and grouping into meaningful units 
   - Single container can be created inside another container along with additional tasks
   - Sequence, ForLoop, ForEachLoop are containers 

  Control flow tasks :- 
   - Perform high level of operations such as sending email message, executing SQL statement or copying file from FTP 
   - If package contain more than one control flow task, they are connected and sequenced with precedence constraint
   - When control flow task is finished, it either succeeds or fails

  Precedence constraints :- 
   - Connect tasks and container inside control flow 
   - Specify condition that determines whether task will run or not
   - It can be configured by logical AND or logical OR expressions and succeed or fail
   - One task connected to another with multiple precedence constraints
  
  SSIS Task :-
   - About SSIS task in Above Question



2. Write Note on ETL? 
 - ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load
 - It is process in which ETL tool extracts data from various data source systems, transforms it in staging area and 
   then finally loads it into Data Warehouse
 - ETL process managed by set of rules, sequence and logic store in metadata

 Diagram :- Extract Source(RDBMS,FILES)  --> Staging area(Transform) --> Datawarehouse(Load)

 Extract :-
  - First step of ETL process is extraction. 
  - Data from various source systems is extracted which can be in various formats like relational databases, No SQL,
    XML, and flat files into staging area. 
  - It important to store extract data into staging area before load into DW because extracted data is in various
    formats and can be corrupted also
  - Loading data directly into data warehouse may damage it and rollback will much more difficult

 Transformation :- 
  - Second step of ETL process is transformation
  - In this step Set of rules or functions are applied on extracted data to convert it into single standard format
  - It involve following processes/tasks :- 
    Filtering – Filter data based on certain attributes
    Cleaning  – Filling up NULL values with default values and mapping it
    Joining   – Joining multiple attributes into one
    Splitting – Splitting single attribute into multiple attributes
    Sorting   – Sorting tuples on basis of some attribute(generally key-attribute)

 Loading :- 
  - Third and final step of ETL process is loading
  - In this step Transformed data finally loaded into data warehouse
  - Data in DW updated very frequently and sometime done after longer but regular intervals
  - Rate and period of loading solely depends on requirements and varies from system to system
 


3. Explain Foreach loop container Control with Example?
 - Loops are used to execute one or more statements repeatedly until specific condition satisfied
 - Foreach Loop Container is more complicated than ForLoop Container because its require more complex configuration
 - It repeat control flow task for N number of times
 - SSIS provides eight types of enumerators

 - Select enumerator type from collection tab within SSIS Foreach Loop Container editor :
  Foreach item enumerator - Loop Set of items that defined manually within SSIS Foreach Container
  Foreach File enumerator - Loop files within specific directory
  Foreach ADO enumerator  - Loop rows in ADO Recordset
  Foreach SMO enumerator  - Loop SMO objects as available servers
  Foreach NodeList enumerator      - Loop result set of XML Path Language (XPath) expression
  Foreach HDFS File enumerator     - Loop files that located within Hadoop distributed file system
  Foreach from Variable enumerator - Loop items that stored within SSIS variable type object

 Example :-
  - Add vendor and product text file to SQL Server
  - Drag and drop Flow task, flat file source --> Configure file
  - Right-click Flat File --> Goto Edit option → Connect file in Connection Manager
  - Check column -> Click OK 
  - Drag and drop ADO.NET Destination for store text file data in SQL Server
  - Right-click ADO.NET Destination → Goto Connection Manager → New
  - Enter Server name and Database name -> Click OK
  - Configure properties to insert data check mapping --> Click OK
  - Select ForEachLoop -> Create variable -> Configure ForEachLoop
  - Go to Collection Select Foreach File Enumerator -> Select created variale
  - Go to DataFlow --> Right-click on flat file connection manager properties
  - Set expression -> Select Connection string and go to Expression
  - In Expression drag and drop variable --> Set Delay ValidationsTRUE 
  - Then run packag -> Check table in SQL Server



4. Explain How to create dynamic packages?
 - When develop package in Microsoft SSIS its good practice to make each task or transformation as dynamic as possible
 - It Enable to move package from one environment to another without opening and changing package
 - SQLServer 2012 provide two feature such as parameters and project-level connection managers which set 
   values dynamic at runtime
 - Two Types of parameters available :- Project, Package
 - Parameter Allow you to assign values to properties within package at time of package execution
 - Use and set parameters only in project deployment model
 - When using project deployment model, project deployed to Integration Services Catalog

 Defining Parameters :-
  - Create project parameters by selecting Project.params in solution explore under project name
  Specify parameters property :-
    Name      :- Name of parameter, first character must be letter or underscore
    DataType  :- Paramert Data type
    Value     :- Assign parameter value at design time
    Sensitive :- If true, parameter value are encrypted in catelog
    Required  :- Default specified before package can be executed
    Description :- For Maintainability description of parameter
  
 Example :- In this example we use Package Level Parameters to filter source data  
  - Start SSDT Open Project --> Open Package  --> Select parameters tab 
  - Click Add parameter button on toolbar
  - Name parameter pYear  --> Set datatype to int16 --> Set value 2002
  - Click Dataflow tab 
  - Open Person OLEDB Source Adapter --> Change data access mode to SQL Command and enter following query   
  - Query :- Select * from Person.Person where year(ModifiedDate) >= ?
  - Click parameter button to set Query parameter dialog box
  - For variable property, select $Package::pYear parameter as source for query parameter
  - Execute package and observe number of rows displayed in data flow area
  - Change parameter value to 2008 and execute package
